<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface">Preface.</a></h2>

<p class="p2">As the closing chapters of this volume were being
written, a "Napoleonic wave" seemed to be passing over
the country, an echo, no doubt, of the furore which Napoleon's
name has excited in France during the past three
years. One writer wittily says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">"Where'er I turn, I'm forced to learn,</div>
    <div class="line">Some detail of his life,</div>
    <div class="line">I read about his sword and hats,</div>
    <div class="line">And how he beat his wife."</div>
  </div>
</div></div>

<p>It seems but fair, therefore, for the author of this volume
to declare that the revival of interest in the career of the
man who for fifteen years had been the glory of France,
has in no way caused the hasty writing, or publication, of
this anecdotal military history. It is the result of years
of study, and represents, not only a careful reading of
those authorities which all must have access to who would
write intelligently of the subject, but also of the more
recent volumes which have appeared from time to time,
each having something new to reveal concerning the
seemingly inexhaustible fund of information pertaining to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
this son of a poor Corsican gentleman, who as his greatest
biographer has said of him, "played in the world the
parts of Alexander, Hannibal, Cæsar and Charlemagne."</p>

<p>There has never been a time, during the last fifty years
at least, when the public was not eager to learn something
new concerning the wonderful career of the man who
once held all Europe prisoner in the folds of the French
flag. The world regards Napoleon Bonaparte as a <i>military
genius</i> at least, whatever it may think of the political or
social side of his life, and its relation to France. The
writer does not believe that they are inseparably connected,
and in offering this work it is his desire to better
acquaint the admirers, as well as the enemies of the
"Little Corporal," with his military career, not technically,
but to picture him as his marshals, generals and
soldiers knew him on the battlefield and around the
campfire.</p>

<p>Many of these famous marshals and generals, who
shared day by day all the glories and perils of their chief,
and who vied with him in their activity and daring, have
lately given to the world their "Memoirs," published
many years after their death, for obvious reasons. From
them one gets a much clearer insight into the true
characteristics of their heroic leader. Being men of slight
education their writings are confined largely to the gossip
of the campaigns in which they were active participants,
and in reading them one is often tempted to believe that
Napoleon was in command of both belligerent armies, so
accurately did this giant among warriors forecast the movements
of the enemy on the battlefield; and after victory
had favored his bold strokes, finding himself in a position
to reshape, at will, the map of Europe; for he conducted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
his campaigns with a degree of skill which, it is conceded
by all military authorities, has never been excelled.</p>

<p>No man ever understood how to excite emulation, by
distributing praise or blame, as did Napoleon. Chaboulon
well says that the ascendancy possessed by the Emperor
over the minds and courage of the soldiery was truly
incomprehensible. A word, a gesture, was sufficient to
inspire them with enthusiasm, and make them face the
most terrible ordeals. If ordered to rush to a point,
although the extreme danger of the manoeuvre might at
first strike the good sense of the soldiers, they immediately
reflected that their general would not have issued such a
command without a motive, or have exposed them wantonly.
"He knows what he is about," they would say,
and immediately rush on to death, uttering shouts of
"Long live the Emperor!"</p>

<p>No attempt is here made to give a history of France
from the time Bonaparte first made his entrance into the
drama of which he was so soon to be the leading actor.
The successive periods of the Revolution, the Directory,
the Consulate and the Empire are only introduced when
found necessary to explain the rapidly advancing steps
of this wonderful character in history, the worshiped idol
of an entire nation, that his military career may be the
better understood; hence it has been thought advisable to
refer briefly, at times, to the relations of France with other
countries, and the cause of his spending, during the ten
years of his reign as Emperor, exactly fifty-four days less
in camp, and under the enemy's fire, so to speak, than he
did in his royal residences!</p>

<p>This, then, is the story of the man who personally
commanded in 600 skirmishes, and 85 pitched battles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
resigning at last his leadership on the field of Waterloo, a
victim of treachery and incompetency exceeding even his
own well-grounded fears; but even after these years of
constant warfare and conquest, after maintaining huge
armies in almost all parts of the world, he left France the
richest nation in the universe, and in possession of a
larger amount of specie than the rest of Europe; and notwithstanding
the fact that in 1796, when he was given
command of the Army of Italy, he found his government
not only incapable of paying its ragged and weary troops,
but unable, even, to feed them!</p>

BOYHOOD DAYS AND EARLY CAREER</h2>

<p class="p2">When Napoleon was a pupil of the Military School at
Brienne, as a pensioner of the king, he wrote to his
mother in Corsica:</p>

<p>"With Homer in my pocket, and my sword by my side,
I hope to carve my way through the world!"</p>

<p>Bonaparte was then a youth of but ten years of age.
For nearly thirty-five years from this time his life was a
series of achievements, the success of which has rarely
been equalled,&mdash;from a military standpoint, never.</p>

<p>His infancy was only different from that of most other
boys in that he showed great animation of temper, and
an impatience of inactivity, by which children of quick
perception and lively sensibility are usually distinguished.</p>

<p>It has been said that the name "Napoleon" was given
to the new-born infant of Madame Bonaparte, according
to a common custom among Catholics, of naming the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
after the saint on whose festival it is baptized, and that the
16th of August, the day of young Bonaparte's baptism,
was the festival of St. Napoleon, (Napoleone), a saint then
peculiar to Corsica.</p>

<p>On the confirmation of young Bonaparte at the Paris
Military School the archbishop who officiated, manifesting
some astonishment at the name "Napoleon," said he
did not know of any such saint, and that there was no
such name in the calendar.</p>

<p>"That should be no rule," replied Napoleon quickly,
"since there are an immense number of saints, but only
three hundred and sixty-five days!"</p>

<p>While an exile at St. Helena Napoleon said to O'Meara,
his surgeon, "Saint Napoleon ought to be much obliged
to me, and place all his credit in the other world to my
account. The poor devil! No one knew him once, he had
not even a day in the calendar. I procured him one, and
persuaded the pope to assign to him the 15th of August,
my birthday."</p>

<p>It has frequently been said of Napoleon that he was
born to command. From his earliest youth he chose arms
for his profession, and in every study likely to be of service
to the future soldier he distinguished himself above his
contemporaries. With the mathematical tutors he was
always a great favorite. His ardor for the abstract sciences
amounted to a passion, and was combined with a singular
aptitude for applying them to the purposes of war, while
his attention to pursuits so interesting in themselves was
stimulated by his natural ambition and desire of distinction
in this science.</p>

<p>Even before Napoleon began his systematic training for
a military career, and while but nine years of age, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
developed a fondness for mimic warfare that frequently
astonished his older companions, many of whom were his
superiors both in strength and endurance; but none of
whom were able to cope with him in strategy, or whose
resources, when put to test, were so versatile. At Ajaccio,
the place of his birth, the city boys were often engaged in
personal encounters with the youths from the country. At
first these contests were but the natural outcome of a
jealousy which is so often found to exist between city and
country boys, who meet upon the same playground. At
length this feeling of rivalry became more bitter, and on
some occasions, especially on holidays, when the country
lads were in the habit of "coming to town," as many as a
score of them were often to be found on each side engaged
in pitched battles with sticks and stones.</p>

<div id="i_019" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 300px;">
  <a href="images/i_019.jpg">
    <img src="images/i_019s.jpg" width="300" height="193" class="figborder" alt="Bonaparte at the Siege of Toulon" />
  </a>
  <div class="captionl">From a Drawing by F. Grenier</div>
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bonaparte at the Siege of Toulon</span></div>
</div>

<p>The country youths had for a time been eminently
successful in these encounters, and were disposed to
braggadocio manners. They went about the streets with
their heads lifted high, and as a result, the older folks soon
began to take an interest in the outcome of the assaults.
On several occasions, too, the parents of the youths were
interested spectators of the contests, and although the
flying missiles were extremely likely to injure the onlooker,
no suggestion of putting an end to the battles was ever
proposed by the older heads.</p>

<p>Young Bonaparte was much chagrined at these defeats,
and sought to find reasons for them. When not an active
participant he would often withdraw to some secluded
spot, and there watch the movements of either side, hoping,
no doubt, to detect some flaw in their manner of fighting
that he might take advantage of it at a later date, and thus
recover the good name of his city comrades. It could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
be in numbers that defeat lay for they were almost always
equally divided, and besides, there seemed to be an
unwritten law between them that "Man against man"
must in common honor be observed.</p>

<p>Finally Bonaparte hastily gathered about him a few of
his chosen friends, in whom he had the most confidence,
and laid before them a plan, which, if followed, he assured
them would not only humiliate their hated rivals, but
would also result in their complete overthrow. With
shouts of approval his plan was at once declared "a tip-top
one" and his lieutenants proceeded to carry out his orders.
He directed that a certain number of boys be formed into
a company, whose duty it should be to supply ammunition.
A "defi" was then sent to the conquerors who promptly
replied that they had nothing to fear. It soon became
noised about among the inhabitants of Ajaccio that a
"final contest" was to be fought on a certain day, and
hours before the time set, hundreds of spectators were on
hand to witness the contest which was destined to re-establish
the prestige of the city boys. At length the fated
hour arrived and the country boys made their appearance
on the battlefield, armed with short sticks,&mdash;their usual
weapons,&mdash;and full of confidence. For a short time
Napoleon and his followers maintained their position
against these sturdy warriors, although, as heretofore, they
found themselves overmatched by mere force of brute
strength.</p>

<p>Napoleon now gave the signal agreed upon to retreat.
Slowly his forces gave way, endeavoring at the same time
to keep up an appearance of fighting to the best of their
ability. To reassure the country chaps that they were
overpowering their contestants purely on their fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
merits, an occasional rally was ordered by the city leader;
but this show of resistance was always followed by him
with another retreat more pronounced than that which
preceded it. At length Napoleon found himself with his
followers on the shore of the sandy beach and the country
lads believed themselves conquerors once more. "Victory!"
"Victory!" they cried, as they came rushing up,
expecting a complete surrender. In their haste to make
a final assault the pursuers had not noticed that each of
the city boys had laid down his stick and had his hand
upon the ground. In it was grasped tightly a stone which
was still partially covered by the sands of the beach.</p>

<p>"Ready! Fire!" shouted Napoleon, and immediately
the air was filled with swift-flying stones, each of which
was followed by a second and that by a third missile, all
landing with terrific force on the unprotected heads and
shoulders of the over-confident country lads. They had
cried victory before the battle was won.</p>

<p>In another moment they found themselves disorganized
and the victims of shouts of derision that came from the
spectators who had followed the retreating forces to see the
final outcome of the battle. Sticks at a distance of 20 or
30 feet were no match for the new weapons of the city lads,
and reluctantly they turned and fled, having themselves
no stones to throw.</p>

<p>Now it was Napoleon's forces who were the pursuers;
but the ranks of the sturdy country lads were sadly depleted
and their resistance was brief.</p>

<p>That night Napoleon was a hero in Ajaccio. With the
older folks gathered about him he told and retold how he
and his followers had spent the preceding night burying
stones in the sand, that they might have them for weapons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
on the morrow when Napoleon's plan, which included
retreat to this point on the beach, might be turned into
the victory they had been assured would follow their arrival
there.</p>

<p>The student of Napoleon's military campaigns will detect
in this manoeuvre a striking similarity to more sanguine
contests on the battlefield where human lives were at stake.</p>

<p>Throughout his life Napoleon's stronghold was strategy,
and never was it more clearly illustrated than in this
harmless contest of his youth, and to which he often
recurred when passing an hour or two with his marshals
and generals while preparing for contests on which the fate
of France depended.</p>

<p>Up to a few years ago,&mdash;it may to this present time,&mdash;an
interesting relic of Napoleon's childhood was preserved
in his native place. It was a small brass cannon, weighing
about thirty pounds, and it is said he would leave all other
amusements for the pleasure of firing off this dangerous
plaything. His favorite retreat was a solitary summer
house, among the rocks on the sea shore, about a mile
from Ajaccio, where his mother's brother had a villa. The
place is now in ruins; it afterwards came to be known as
"Napoleon's Grotto." Nothing interested him more
during these early years, than to hear his mother tell the
story of her exciting hardships as she fled from one part
of the island to another before the conquering French.
Thus, unconsciously, she no doubt nurtured in her second
son that warlike spirit which was manifested in him to
such a marked degree in after years.</p>

<p>During the time Napoleon attended school, young men
were taught that the only fame worth striving for was that
won by military achievements. Napoleon's parents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
therefore, exerted all the influence they could command to
gain scholarships for the education of their two oldest
sons,&mdash;Joseph and Napoleon. Their prayers were at last
granted owing to the invaluable aid of Monsieur de
Marboeuf, Bishop of Autun and nephew of the governor
of Corsica. Joseph was to take orders and to be placed in
the college of Autun; Napoleon, intended for the navy,
was to go to the school at Brienne, having previously gone
through a course at Autun so as to learn sufficient French
to be able to follow the lectures. They started on this
journey, which was to have so much influence on their
future lives, on December 15, 1778. After a halt at
Florence to procure papers showing the ancient nobility
of the Bonaparte family, and which were necessary to
Napoleon before entering the school at Brienne, they proceeded
to Autun. The herald declared that, "Young
Napoleon Bonaparte possessed the nobility necessary for
admission into the ranks of the gentlemen who are educated
by his Majesty in the royal schools." Charles Bonaparte
had been able to satisfy the authorities that his patent of
nobility was authentic and privileged him to sign his name
"de Bonaparte."</p>

<p>Napoleon arrived at Brienne, on the 23d of April, 1779,
having in three months at Autun "learned sufficient
French to enable him to converse easily and to write small
essays and translations."</p>

<p>At Brienne Bourrienne, whose friendship for him commenced
thus early, describes him as follows: "Bonaparte
was noticeable at Brienne for his Italian complexion, the
keenness of his look, and the tone of his conversation with
masters and comrades. There was almost always a dash
of bitterness in what he said. He had very little of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
disposition that leads to attachments; which I can only
attribute to the misfortunes of his family ever since his
birth and the impression that the conquest of his country
had made on his early years."</p>

<p>The fact that he was a brave, manly boy, all biographers
agree in recording. His poverty subjected him to mortification
among his comrades, who also ridiculed him on
account of his country and twitted him with the obsolete
saint whose name he bore. These taunts he allowed
himself to settle with the offenders openly and never
descended to report them to his tutors. On one occasion,
with Bourrienne, who became his private secretary in later
years, he suffered several days' imprisonment rather than
reveal the names of the real offenders who had neglected
their duties.</p>

<p>Napoleon's promptitude of reply was displayed on many
occasions during his attendance at this school. One day
as he was undergoing an examination by a general officer,
he answered all the questions proposed with so much precision,
and accompanied by such a depth of penetration,
that the general, the professors and the students, were
astonished. At length, in order to bring the interrogatories
to a close, Napoleon was asked the following question:</p>

<p>"What line of conduct would you adopt in case you
were besieged in a fortified place and was destitute of
provisions?"</p>

<p>"So long as there were any in the camp of the enemy,
I should never be at a great loss for a supply," came the
answer quickly, amid the applause of the pupils.</p>

<p>One of the most delightful winters of Napoleon's early
life was that of 1782, spent at this military school. He
was just at that age when a boy most keenly enjoys new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
scenes and new excitements. It was the thirteenth winter
of his life. He was older than most boys are at thirteen.
His mind and his muscles were better developed. But,
nevertheless, he was still a boy.</p>

<p>It happened that this winter was one of the coldest and
most severe in the history of France, so memorable by the
quantity of snow that fell and which accumulated upon
the roads in great quantities. The snow came early and
stayed late, and the students could find but little amusement
without doors. Napoleon was the first to suggest
that it be used to develop their practical knowledge, and
at the same time to beguile the weary hours they would
otherwise be compelled to spend within doors. He said
one day:</p>

<p>"Let us divide into two hostile forces and battle, while
the snow lasts, for the possession of the play ground."</p>

<p>The proposition was received with favor and was unanimously
accepted. By common consent Napoleon, whose
authority no one questioned, was chosen to command
the projected mimic war, the school being divided into
two equal armies. Extensive fortifications of snow were
at once erected by busy hands who then armed themselves
for the coming fray. So complete were the arrangements
that even the inhabitants of the village gave up all other
pursuits to witness the battles. For fifteen days, while the
snow lasted, they built forts and counter-forts, dug trenches,
constructed bastions and made or met sallies with snowball
battles, neglecting for the nonce their less interesting
studies.</p>

<p>It is related that Napoleon was greatly enraged one day
to find that the other side had tried to get the best of his
men by putting a round stone into each snowball, but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
someone advised him to imitate the tactics of the foe he
indignantly refused, saying that he would win without
doing so or be beaten.</p>

<p>The fort of the enemy was at last captured after Napoleon
had gone through the formalities of a siege, in which he
displayed much of the quickness of combination for which
he was noted on the battlefield in after years. His soldierly
methods electrified his fellow students and astonished the
professors as well. "This little sham war," says Bourrienne,
"was carried on for the space of a fortnight, and
did not cease until a quantity of gravel and small stones
having got mixed with the snow of which we made our
bullets, many of the combatants, besiegers as well as
besieged, were seriously wounded. I well remember that
I was one of the worst sufferers from this sort of grape-shot
fire."</p>

<p>In 1783 Bonaparte, on the recommendation of the
inspector of the twelve military schools, was sent from
Brienne to the Royal Military School at Paris to have his
education completed in the general school,&mdash;an extraordinary
compliment to the genius and proficiency of a boy of
fifteen. He was one of three to receive that honor, a
tribute paid to the precocity of his extraordinary mathematical
talent, and the steadiness of his application. The
entry made at that time in the military records says:</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Bonaparte (Napoleon) born August 15th,
1769; in height four feet, ten inches, ten lines; of good
constitution, health excellent, character mild, honest and
grateful; conduct exemplary; has distinguished himself
by application to mathematics; understands history and
geography tolerably well; is indifferently skilled in merely
ornamental studies, as well as in Latin; would make an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
excellent sailor; deserves to be passed to the Military
School at Paris."</p>

<p>The young student did not arrive in Paris in the
guise of the future conqueror of the world. On the
contrary, he looked like a "new-comer;" he gaped
at everything he saw, and gazed about in a dazed
sort of way. As a Corsican compatriot who met him as
he was getting out of the coach has said: "His appearance
was that of a youth whom any scoundrel would try
to rob after seeing him, if indeed he had anything worth
taking!" However, it should not be forgotten that he
was but a youth of fifteen, felt his poverty keenly, and was
about to enter into the noise and extravagant life of the
rich students of this royal military school. As he himself
said in 1811: "All these cares spoiled my early years;
they influenced my temper and made me grave before my
time."</p>

<p>At the Paris school Napoleon labored hard, as he
had done at Brienne for five years, being especially
proficient, as before, in mathematics. Everything was
very luxurious here, and Bonaparte complained in a
memorial, which he presented to the superintendent of
the establishment, that the mode of life was too
expensive and delicate for "poor gentlemen" and
could not properly prepare them either for returning
to their "modest homes," or for the hardships they would
encounter in war. He proposed that instead of a regular
dinner of two courses daily, the students should have
ammunition bread and soldiers' rations, and be compelled
to mend and clean their own stockings and shoes. "If I
were king of France," he said one day to a companion,
"I would change this state of things very quickly!" This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
memorial is said to have done him no service, for every
third boy that looked on him was a duke from his cradle,
while the Young Corsican was still a "pensioner of the
king;" but the schools established by him after he became
Emperor were on that severe plan. "Although believing
in the necessity of show and magnificence in public
life," says Meneval, his second private secretary,
"Napoleon remained true to these principles, while
lavishing wealth on his ministers and marshals: 'In your
private life' said he, 'be economical and even parsimonious;
in public be magnificent.'"</p>

<p>On being reproved one day by an uncle of the Duchess
d'Abrantes for ingratitude as a "pensioner of the king,"
he broke out furiously with an expression of indignation.
"Silence!" said the gentleman at whose table he was
sitting; "It ill becomes you, who are educated by the
king's bounty, to speak as you do."</p>

<p>"I am not educated at the <i>king's</i> expense," replied
Bonaparte, his face flushed with rage, "but at the expense
of the <i>nation</i>!"</p>

<p>Young Napoleon made but poor advancement in the
German language while at this school, and by reason of it
offended M. Bauer his tutor. One day, not being in
his place, M. Bauer inquired where he was, and was
told that he was attending his examination in the
class of artillery.</p>

<p>"Oh! so he does learn something," said the professor
ironically.</p>

<p>"Why, sire, he is the best mathematician in the school,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"Ah, I have always heard it remarked and I have always
believed, that none but a fool could learn mathematics!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"It would be curious," said Napoleon, who related this
anecdote when he was Emperor, "to know whether M.
Bauer lived long enough to ascertain my real character,
and to enjoy the confirmation of his own judgment."</p>

<p>Napoleon had not been in the Military School of Paris a
year,&mdash;during which time his father had died,&mdash;and had
barely completed his sixteenth year, when he successfully
passed the examination, in August 1785,&mdash;for a commission
in a regiment of artillery.</p>

<p>On September 1st the decree was signed which assigned
Bonaparte as Second-Lieutenant in the company of bombardiers
of the regiment of La Fere garrisoned at Valence.
At the time of the examination there were thirty-six vacant
places. M. de Feralio, one of the professors of the military
school charged with this examination, is said to have
inscribed on the margin, opposite to the signature of
Napoleon, the following: "A Corsican by character and
by birth. If favored by circumstances this young man
will rise high." This professor was very fond of
his young pupil, and when at school is said to have
occasionally supplied him with pocket money. After his
death Napoleon granted a handsome pension to his widow.</p>

<p>Napoleon's corps was at Valence when he joined it.
Arriving there he was an occasional frequenter of the
drawing room of Madame du Colombier, and it is said he
made love to her daughter; but when not so engaged, he
was devoted to his military studies, and read frequently
from the Lives of Plutarch, a volume of which he generally
carried about him. He also occupied himself in writing
a "History of Corsica" which, when completed, the Abbe
Raynal and other friends praised very highly; but he was
unable to find a publisher for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>At Valence Napoleon found the officers of his regiment
divided, as all the world then was, into two parties; the
lovers of the French monarchy, and those who desired its
overthrow. Napoleon openly sided with the latter. "Had
I been a general," said he, in the evening of his life, "I
might have adhered to the king; being a subaltern I joined
the patriots."</p>

<p>In the beginning of 1792 Napoleon became captain of
artillery, unattached, and happening to be in Paris, witnessed
the lamentable scenes of the 20th of June, when
the revolutionary mob stormed the Tuileries, and Louis
XVI. and his family, after undergoing innumerable insults
and degradations, with the utmost difficulty preserved their
lives. As he was strolling about with Bourrienne he saw
the mob, numbering between five and six thousand, ragged
and ridiculously armed, coming from the outskirts and
making for the Tuileries. "Let us follow these scoundrels,"
he said. They went with the crowd into the garden
before the palace, and when the king appeared at one of
the windows on the balcony, surrounded by Revolutionists,
and with the red cap of liberty, the emblem of the Jacobins, on
his head, Napoleon could no longer suppress his contempt
and indignation. "Poor driveller!" said he, loud enough
to be heard by those near him; "how could he suffer this
rabble to enter? If he had swept away five or six hundred
with his cannon, <i>the rest would be running yet</i>!" Napoleon
always abhorred anarchy. He said there was no remedy
for mobs but grape-shot, and believed thoroughly in the
theory of shooting first and listening to peace negotiations
afterwards.</p>

<p>He was also a witness of the still more terrible 10th of
August, in the same year, when the palace being once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
more invested, the National Guard assigned for its defense
took part with the assailants. This time the royal family
were obliged to take refuge in the National Assembly, and
the brave Swiss Guards were massacred almost to a man.</p>

<p>Bonaparte was a firm friend of the Assembly, to the
charge of a part of which, at least, these excesses must be
laid; but the spectacle disgusted him. The yells, screams,
and pikes with bloody heads upon them, formed a scene
which he afterwards described as "hideous and revolting."
But with what a different feeling of interest would he
have looked on that infuriated populace, those still
resisting though overpowered Swiss, and that burning
palace, had any seer whispered to him: "Emperor that
shall be, all this blood and massacre is but to prepare your
future Empire!"</p>

<p>He mingled little in society; but he saw much of the
people and took sides irrevocably with the cause of the
nation. At this time he was without employment and
very poor, wandering idly about Paris, and living chiefly at
cheap restaurants. As yet he had been but a spectator of
the Revolution, destined to pave his own path to sovereign
power; but it was not long before circumstances called
him to play a part in this tragic drama which was then
attracting the attention of the civilized world.</p>

<p>It was shortly after these stirring scenes in Paris, that
Bonaparte visited his mother in Corsica, arriving there with
his sister Eliza on September 17th, 1792. For the first time
in thirteen years the family was reunited, and their joy
would have been complete had their circumstances not been
so sad. Their resources were diminishing day by day and
the recovery of what was due them became constantly more
difficult, owing to civil discords. The only fund upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
which they could rely seems to have been Napoleon's pay
as an artillery officer.</p>

<p>The following year, while Bonaparte was still enjoying
the leave of absence from his regiment, an expedition arrived
from France to deprive General Paoli, governor of Corsica,
of his control, he having denounced the National
Assembly as the enemy of France. Paoli endeavored to
enlist Napoleon in his cause; among other flatteries
he patted him on the back and said: "You
were cast in an antique mould; you are one of Plutarch's
men. The whole world will talk of you," but the young
Corsican was loyal to France, and was not to be deceived
by either entreaties or flattery. He declared his belief
that Corsica was too weak to maintain independence,
that she must fall under the rule either of France
or England, and that her interests would be best served
by adhering to the former. Napoleon then tendered his
sword to Salicetti, one of the Corsican deputies to the Convention,
and was appointed provisionally to the command
of a battalion of National Guards.</p>

<p>The first military service on which he was employed for
his native country was the reduction of a small fortress,
called the Torre di Capitello, near Ajaccio. He took it,
but was soon besieged in it, and he and his garrison, after a
gallant defense, and living for some time on horseflesh, were
glad to evacuate the tower, and escape to the sea. Paoli
was soon reinforced by England, and the Bonapartes
were among those who were banished from the country.
During this Corsican revolution the inhabitants were much
divided as to the rights of England and France in the
island. An officer in the French troops, who sided with
England, was much scandalized at the position taken by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the Bonapartes,&mdash;Joseph, Napoleon and Lucien. One
day, in the hearing of Napoleon, the officer made use of
some very harsh language towards them, and was
especially bitter against Napoleon. At this a friend defended
him with much warmth and finished by saying to
the officer: "Sir, you are not worth a pair of Napoleon's
old boots!"</p>

<p>In the year 1800, Napoleon then being First Consul of
France, the officer who had defended him, and who
had for some time followed his standard, and had been
raised to distinction by him, happening to meet Bonaparte
among a large party at dinner at the house of the First
Consul's mother, was drawn aside before the company
placed themselves at the table, and with his finger over his
mouth, Napoleon said in a half-joking, half-serious manner:
"My dear sir, not a word, I entreat you, about the
old boots!"</p>

<p>As a result of the insurrection in Corsica Napoleon saw
Ajaccio in ashes, and the home of his childhood pillaged
and burned ere he took his departure. His mother and
sisters took refuge first at Nice, and afterwards at Marseilles,
where for some time they suffered all the
inconveniences of poverty and exile. At that period
nothing was more deplorable than Bonaparte's prospects;
nothing more uncertain than the future. But
he believed that fortune would not always abandon
him. France was in the hands of men who acted largely
from self-interest, and here he apparently saw a chance to
carve his way to fame by getting in the vortex of the
Revolution. It was probably on this occasion that he
repeated the well-known words: "In a revolution a soldier
should never despair if he possesses courage and genius."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Napoleon now resolved to rejoin his regiment; he had
chosen France for his country, and ever afterwards
it was his home until exiled to St. Helena.</p>

<p>During the night of August 27th, 1793, Toulon was
delivered to the English, and its subsequent siege and
retaking was destined to be the first incident of importance
which enabled Bonaparte to distinguish himself in the eyes
of the French Government, and of the world at large. The
head of Louis XVI had rolled from the block, and a
month afterwards the Convention had declared war against
England.</p>

<p>Early in September France was attacked on every
side, and a third of her provinces had rebelled against
the government established at Paris, which enforced its
supremacy by a regime carried on under a Reign of Terror.
Among the provinces in open insurrection were all
those of the south. An army corps invested Lyons, while
another, after subduing Marseilles, marched against Toulon,
the great arsenal and seaport, and delivered by the Bourbons
into the hands of England. Adjutant Cervoni
was at once dispatched to Marseilles to ascertain if he
could find in that town some artillery officer of distinction
to whom might be intrusted the chief command
of the siege batteries before Toulon.</p>

<p>While strolling through the streets Cervoni met with a
captain of artillery who was, like himself, perambulating
the thoroughfares. This captain was a Corsican and a
compatriot; his name was Napoleon Bonaparte. He was
covered with the dust of the road along which he had
been walking; for he had just arrived from Avignon,
whither he had escorted a convoy of ammunition, and
was on his way to Nice. Cervoni thought that Bona<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>parte
would be just the man to watch over the
movements of the army before Toulon: he appeared very
young,&mdash;he was only twenty-four years of age&mdash;but it was
stated that a month before the Republican army was on
the point of beating a retreat in front of Avignon when he,
with two field-pieces and eighty men, bombarded the town
in the rear so effectively that the inhabitants and federal
troops were overcome with fright and, convinced that they
had been betrayed, abandoned the place to the Republicans
who entered victorious, thanks to the boldness and
foresight of Captain Bonaparte.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bonaparte Escapes Capture at Lonato</span></div>
</div>

<p>Cervoni invited him to enter a café; Bonaparte
accepted, and the two men had a chat over a bowl of
punch. The young captain doffed his hat, so that his
features were lighted up by the blue flame of the liquor;
his complexion was sallow and his head large, measuring
as it did twenty-three inches round. If the size of his
skull was large, the space between the two cheek-bones
was enormous. The hair grew low on his forehead; the
well-arched brows disclosed large eyes, sharp as steel, cold,
clear and piercing; the aquiline nose was of the most
delicate shape, the lower lip strong and receding, while
the chin and the jaws were as well developed as the skull.</p>

<p>After a conference Napoleon departed for Toulon where
he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General of
Artillery, with the command of the artillery during the
siege. The arsenal was filled with military stores, and
twenty-five English and Spanish battleships were then
riding in the harbor to protect it. Three months had
passed, during which time no apparent progress had
been made towards the recapture of the town, and when
Napoleon arrived he was invested with the command of the
artillery train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>A strong fort commanded the harbor, and after a careful
examination Napoleon said the only way to retake Toulon
was to neglect the body of the town, carry "Little
Gibraltar," and the city would surrender in two days.
Napoleon's brother Lucien visited him about this time.
They went together one morning to a place where a fruitless
assault had been made, and two hundred Frenchmen were
dead upon the ground. On beholding them Napoleon
exclaimed: "If I had commanded here all these brave
men would still be alive!" A moment later he
added: "Learn from this example, young man, how indispensable
and imperatively necessary it is for those to
possess knowledge who aspire to the command of others."</p>

<p>Napoleon's own account of his experiences here is
extremely interesting, and was thus related by him during
his exile at St. Helena:</p>

<p>"I reported, as I had been ordered to do," he said, "to
General Cartaux, (a portrait painter of Paris) who was
in charge of the revolutionary forces. He was a tall man,
all covered with gilt decorations, and a type of the militia
officer. I saw at once that he was utterly incompetent to
the task that had been laid out for him. I said: 'I have
been directed to assist, under your order, in the taking of
Toulon.' He replied: 'We need no assistance in taking
Toulon; but since they have sent you here you may enjoy
yourself as best you can and see the siege.' Then he gave
orders to have me treated with courtesy.</p>

<p>"Well, the next morning I went out with the general
to look at the preparations for bombarding the stronghold.
He called an aid-de-camp and asked in a business-like
manner: 'Are the red-hot shot ready?' I was surprised,
but said nothing. The subordinate replied: 'Oh, yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the men have been busy all night heating them.' I was now
more surprised than ever, but still kept silent. What
followed would have made me believe they were trying to
guy me if their manner had not been so serious. General
Cartaux asked how they were going to get the red-hot
shot over to the guns. That seemed to puzzle the aid-de-camp.
The General himself didn't know what to do.
After a great deal of speculation, and some swearing, he
asked me what I would do under the circumstances. I said:</p>

<p>"'You will find it an excellent idea to try the range of
your guns with cold shot first. If the range isn't right
the hot-shot will be of no service.'</p>

<p>"He laughed merrily and agreed with me. The order
was given to try the range. The result was that the cold
shot didn't carry more than a third of the distance. The
bombarding of the fort was put off another day.</p>

<p>"Luckily Gasparin, the direct representative of the
people with plenary powers, came riding up that night,
and I told him what I had seen and heard. He agreed
that the man in command was incompetent, and put me in
charge. You all know the rest. I began the attack on the
outlet of Toulon and was successful. Gasparin consoled
Cartaux by telling him that I was only a subordinate, and
that all the glory would go to him anyhow."</p>

<p>During this siege of the "Little Gibraltar Castle"
Bonaparte showed his extensive knowledge of mankind,
and which enabled him to discover and attach to
him those men whose talents were most distinguished,
and most capable of rendering him service. Several who
afterwards became marshals and generals under the Empire,
first made Napoleon's acquaintance at Toulon.
Among these were Duroc and Junot. During one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
days of this long siege Napoleon, in passing one of the
trenches, called for some one to write an order from his
dictation, and in obedience to this request a young and
handsome soldier stepped out of the ranks, and resting his
paper on the breastwork, began to write as directed.
Scarcely had he done so when a cannon ball fell at his
feet and covered both commander and private with dirt.
The soldier laughingly held up his paper and said:
"Thank you, now I shall need no sand."</p>

<p>Napoleon was so pleased with his bravery, and ready
wit, that he immediately promoted him. The name of this
fortunate man was General Junot; he subsequently became
Duke of Abrantes and was one of the most distinguished
generals of the Empire under Napoleon. An apparent
total insensibility to fatigue was observed in the young
Corsican officer at this time. He worked through daylight,
and slept nights wrapped in a blanket under his
guns till his batteries were ready to begin operations.</p>

<p>During the siege Paris was very restless, and after a few
weeks had passed it became almost the sole topic of conversation
at the capital; the newspapers contained innumerable
suggestions for the ending of the siege, and hundreds of letters
were addressed to the officers at Toulon, telling them how
to drive the English from the shores of France. One day
fifteen carriages arrived at Toulon containing sixty young
men who had journeyed thither from the capital; they
were gorgeously arrayed and asked to be presented to the
commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>Bonaparte received the party courteously and asked what
he could do for them. "Citizen Bonaparte," said the
spokesman, "we come from Paris. The patriots there are
indignant at your indecision and delay. The soil of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Republic has been violated. She trembles to think that
the insult still remains unavenged. She asks, 'Why is
Toulon not yet taken? Why is the English fleet not yet
destroyed?' In her indignation she has appealed to her
brave sons. We have obeyed her summons and burn with
impatience to fulfill her expectations. We are volunteer
gunners from Paris. Furnish us with arms. To-morrow
we will march against the enemy!"</p>

<p>Early on the following day Napoleon conducted the
"volunteers" to the seashore. During the night he had
ordered a number of cannon placed in position and as he
pointed to the black hull out at sea he said: "Sink that
ship!"</p>

<p>At some distance from the shore lay an English frigate,
upon whose deck were to be seen a formidable array of
cannon, all pointed shorewards.</p>

<p>"But there is no shelter here!" said the volunteers in
chorus. At this moment a broadside was fired by the
gunners on the frigate and the brilliantly decorated
patriots from the capital fled in every direction, amid the
smiles of the commander-in-chief who at once gave orders
for his own gunners to return the fire of the enemy.</p>

<p>Toulon was at last retaken on December 17th, the siege
having lasted four months.</p>

<p>When Bonaparte at last raised the French emblem over
the city, and as it floated with the breezes over a scene of
desolation long remembered by those who witnessed it, he
said to Dugommier: "Go to sleep; we have taken Toulon!"</p>

<p>It was here that Napoleon was first severely wounded.
When his body was being prepared for burial at St. Helena
there was found upon his left thigh so deep a scar that it
was nearly possible to place one's finger in it. This had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
been caused by a bayonet thrust received during this
engagement, and in consequence of which he nearly lost his
leg. In addition to the wound he had a number of horses
shot under him. Another of the dangers which he incurred
was of a singular character. An artilleryman being shot
at the gun which he was serving, while Napoleon was visiting
a battery, the commander took up the dead man's
rammer, and to give encouragement to the soldiers,
charged the gun with his own hands. The gunner had
been afflicted with a skin disease which Napoleon contracted
from the weapon, and for a number of years afterward
he suffered from its ravages.</p>

<p>Soon after the retaking of Toulon Bonaparte accompanied
General Dugommier to Marseilles. Some one
struck with his appearance asked the general <i>who that little
bit of an officer was, and where he picked him up</i>?</p>

<p>"That officer's name," replied the general, "is Bonaparte:
I picked him up at the siege of Toulon, to the
successful termination of which he eminently contributed;
and you will probably see, one day, <i>that this little bit of an
officer</i> is a greater man than any of us!"</p>

<p>Napoleon was now rapidly rising in reputation. His
science as an artillery officer and his valor had saved France
from humiliation&mdash;taught her enemies to respect her&mdash;had
suppressed the spirit of insurrection in the southern
provinces, and had given the government of the Convention
control of the whole army.</p>

<p>It has been said that Napoleon's fame first came to the
knowledge of Barras, a member of the Directory, through
a letter taken by his young protegé to Paris not long after
this siege. It was a commendatory letter addressed to
Carnot in which Barras thus expressed himself: "I send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
you a young man who has distinguished himself very much
during the siege, and earnestly recommend you to advance
him speedily: <i>If you do not, he will most assuredly advance
himself!</i>"</p>

<p>Bonaparte's name was on the list of those whom the
veteran Dugommier recommended for promotion, and he
was accordingly confirmed in his provisional situation of
chief of battalion and appointed to hold that rank in Italy.
He therefore proceeded to join the headquarters of the
French army then lying at Nice. Here he suggested a
plan by which the Sardinians were driven from the Coe di
Tendi. Saorgio, with all its stores, soon surrendered, and
the French obtained possession of the maritime Alps, so
that the difficulties of advancing into Italy were greatly
diminished. Of these movements, however, Napoleon's
superior officers reaped as yet the honor. While directing
the means of attaining these successes Bonaparte acquired
a complete acquaintance with that Alpine country in which
he was shortly to obtain victories in his own name, not in
that of others who were now rapidly acquiring reputation
by acting on his timely suggestions.</p>

<p>One of his favorite methods of planning manoeuvres he
originated at this time while studying his maps and plans
of the Alpine country. He had so familiarized himself
with the locality that no point of importance was unknown
to him. With this data before him, Bonaparte would sit
for hours, intent on studying the maps of the country, and
upon which he had stuck pins, the heads of which he had
covered with wax of various shades. One color was used
to designate the French, another the enemy, and by
changing the location of the pins on the map he formed
various intricate plans of attack and retreat that some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
years later were most valuable to him. This ingenious
scheme is often used at the present day by large wholesale
houses to designate the territory of their salesmen while
travelling about the country.</p>

<p>While in Nice Napoleon was suddenly arrested and
thrown into prison on an order sent from Paris by the
Committee of Public Safety. He had been sent there
with secret instructions from the government "to
collect facts that would throw light upon the intentions
of the Genoese government respecting coalition,
etc.," and although he acquitted himself with all the
care necessary to success, his excess of zeal came nearly
ending fatally to him, for it was a time when it was safe
to have secrets from no one. It was a time, too, when
revolutionists owed it to themselves to arrest their predecessors,
and as there had been a change in the government,
Napoleon's secret journey was unknown to Salicetti and
Albitte, who had succeeded Ricord.</p>

<p>Young Robespierre, who received the order of arrest, was
much astounded at it. The document added that the
prisoner was to be at once brought under a strong escort
to Fort Carré near Antibes and there imprisoned and tried
"for treason against the Republic." Robespierre asked
Napoleon to come into his room, and showed him the
document, which might mean death. Then he said: "You
must not go away yet. I will put you under arrest, and
then I will write to my brother, who has some influence
with the committee. He may be able to get the order
rescinded."</p>

<p>Napoleon refused to get agitated over his arrest. Junot,
Sebastiani and Marmont, his young aides-de-camp, had
formed a plan of escape and advised him to choke the guard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
steal a small boat, and flee to the Corsican coast, where he
could hide himself in the mountains. Bonaparte, knowing
his innocence, refused to try to escape, but addressed the
following letter to Junot, et al: "I fully recognize your
friendship, my dear Junot, in the proposition you make me:
you have long known the sincerity of mine for you, and I
hope that you trust in it. Men may be unjust towards me,
my dear Junot, but for me my innocence is sufficient. My
conscience is the tribunal before which I summon my conduct.
This conscience is calm when I question it. Do
nothing, therefore; all friendly greetings. <span class="smcap">Bonaparte</span>.</p>

<div class="right"><i>Under arrest at Fort Carré, Antibes.</i>"<br /></div>

<p>It was only when told that he was dismissed from the
army, and declared unworthy of public confidence, that he
addressed a spirited letter to Albitte and Salicetti, the
committee that ordered his arrest, and which caused them
to reconsider their resolution.</p>

<p>In his dramatic communication to this committee, Bonaparte
said in part: "You have suspended me from my
functions, arrested and declared me suspected. Therein you
have branded me without judging,&mdash;or rather judged without
hearing. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Hear me; destroy the oppression
that environs me, and restore me in the estimation of
patriotic men. An hour after, if villains desire my life, I
shall esteem it but little; I have despised it often."</p>

<p>In a few days the influence of the great Robespierre had
made itself felt; a message was consequently received rescinding
the order and Napoleon was honorably discharged
from custody. His papers had been examined, and as
nothing was found in them to implicate him, he was set at
liberty at once. In those stormy times more than one
innocent man had been sent to the guillotine on a less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
flimsy accusation than this, and Napoleon had, therefore,
good reason to be thankful for the interposition of
Robespierre.</p>

<p>At this time the young warrior was most studious, and
is said to have thus early acquired the habit of taking
short snatches of sleep, which seemed to refresh him fully
as much as the longer periods required by others. While
at Nice one of his friends, on a particular occasion, went
to Napoleon's apartments long before daybreak, and not
doubting that he was still in bed, knocked gently at the
door, fearful of disturbing him too abruptly. Upon entering
his chamber he was not a little astonished at finding
Bonaparte dressed as during the day, with plans, maps and
various books scattered around him.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the visitor, "not yet in bed?"</p>

<p>"In bed," replied Napoleon, "I am already risen."</p>

<p>"Indeed, and why so early?"</p>

<p>"Oh, two or three hours are enough for any man to
sleep!" was the general's reply.</p>

<p>Some years later, when Bonaparte was forming the
"<i>Code Napoleon</i>," he astonished the Council of State by
the readiness with which he illustrated any point in discussion
by quoting the Roman Civil Law, a subject which
might seem entirely foreign to him, since the greater part
of his life had been passed on the battlefield. On being
asked how he had acquired so familiar a knowledge of law
affairs he replied: "When I was lieutenant I was put
under arrest, unjustly, it is true, but that is nothing to the
point. The little room which was assigned for my prison
contained no furniture but an old chair and an old cupboard:
in the cupboard was a ponderous volume, older and
more worm-eaten than all the rest. It proved to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
digest of the Roman law. As I had neither paper, pens,
ink or pencil, you may easily imagine that this book was
a valuable prize to me. It was so voluminous and the
leaves were so covered with marginal notes in manuscript
that, had I been confined one hundred years I could never
have been idle. I was only deprived of my liberty ten
days; but, on recovering it, I was saturated with Justinian
and the decisions of the Roman legislators. <i>Thus, I
picked up my knowledge of the Civil Law.</i>"</p>

<p>Bonaparte did not resume his functions at Nice, after
his release from imprisonment, but repaired to Marseilles
where his mother was living in distressed circumstances.
Before the end of the year he again came
to Paris to solicit employment. At first he met with
nothing but repulses. Aubry, president of the military
committee, objected to his youth, at which Bonaparte
replied rather sharply: "One ages quickly on battlefields,
and I have just left one." The president, who had not
seen much actual service himself, thought he was insulted,
and treated Napoleon very coldly in consequence.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Bonaparte was offered the command
of a brigade of infantry which he refused, declaring that
nothing could induce him to leave the artillery. Writing
to Sucy, a friend, on this subject, Napoleon said: "I
have been ordered to serve as a general of the line in La
Vendée. I will not accept. Many soldiers could direct a
brigade better than I, and few have commanded artillery
with greater success." His refusal was followed by the
erasure of his name from the list of general officers in employment.
Some time later he asked for a commission to
Turkey to form a barrier against the encroachments of
Russia and England, but it was not granted. No answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
was returned to his memorial, over which he conversed for
some weeks with great enthusiasm. "How strange it would
be," he said to his friends, "if a little Corsican should become
king of Jerusalem." Already he was contemplating
greatness, and firmly believed in his "Star of Destiny."</p>

<p>At length he was nominated to the command of a
brigade of artillery in Holland. The long-deferred appointment
was, no doubt, very welcome; but in the meantime
his services were called for in a more important field.
When the National Guard sided with the enemies of the
Convention, and took up arms against the Government, a
man of force and decision was needed to defend them
from the insurgents. A collision had taken place on
October 3rd, 1795, when the troops of the Convention were
withdrawn by that body. The insurgents, who represented
the forty-eight sections of Paris, were prepared to
attack the Palace of the Tuileries next morning with upwards
of 40,000 men, and take the Government in their
own hands. The nation, and especially the superior
classes, aided by the Royalists, were indignant at the
conduct of the members of the Convention,&mdash;who schemed
to perpetuate themselves in office,&mdash;and formed a most formidable
opposition to the measures of the existing Government.</p>

<p>General Bonaparte was at the theatre when informed of
the events that were passing. He at once hastened to the
Assembly where he found the members in the heat of debate
and greatly exercised over their approaching danger.</p>

<p>Deliberating with Tallien and Carnot, Barras, who had
been present at Toulon during the siege, said: "There is
but one man who can save us. I have the man whom you
want; <i>it is a little Corsican officer who will not stand upon</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<i>ceremony!</i>" Napoleon was sent for and notified that he
had been chosen to defend the Government as second in
command under Barras. Unknown to the Assembly,
he had been present at their meeting, and heard all
that had been said of him. He deliberated on the best
course to pursue for more than half an hour, and at last
decided to take up their cause, if allowed to do so in his
own way. When Barras presented Napoleon to the Convention
as a fit man to be intrusted with the command, the
President asked:</p>

<p>"Are you willing to undertake the defense of the Convention?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Are you aware of the magnitude of the undertaking?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly; and I am in the habit of accomplishing
that which I undertake. I accept, but I warn you that,
once my sword is out of the scabbard, I shall not replace
it until I have established order."</p>

<p>He refused, however, to accept the appointment unless
he received it free from all interference. The trembling
Convention quickly yielded, and although Barras enjoyed
the title of "Commander-in-chief," Bonaparte was actually
in control of the troops.</p>

<p>Upon consultation with Menou, who was then in prison,
and whom he succeeded, Napoleon quickly obtained the
information desired. He learned that the available defense
consisted of but 5,000 soldiers of all descriptions,
with 40 pieces of cannon then at Sablons and guarded
by only one hundred and fifty men. Without the loss of
a moment Napoleon began his preparations for the morrow
which was to decide whether the mob was to triumph, and
France lose all the fruits of her Revolution, or law and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
order be established. His first act was to dispatch Murat,
then a major of chasseurs, to Sablons, five miles off, where
the cannon were posted. The Sectionaries sent a stronger
detachment to seize these cannon immediately afterwards;
and Murat, who passed them in the dark, would have gone
in vain had he received his orders but a few moments
later, or had he been less active.</p>

<p>When the reveille sounded on the morning of October
4th, over 32,000 National Guards advanced by different
streets to the siege of the palace; but its defense was in
firmer hands than those of Louis XVI.&mdash;the hero of Toulon
was now at the helm.</p>

<p>At the Church St. Roche the column which was advancing
along the Rue St. Honoré, found a detachment
of Napoleon's troops drawn up in line with two cannon to
dispute their passage. It is unknown which side began the
firing, but in an instant Napoleon's artillery swept the
streets and lanes, scattering grape-shot among the National
Guards, and producing such confusion that they were soon
compelled to give way. The first shot was a signal for
opening all the batteries which Bonaparte had established,
the quays of the Seine opposite the Tuileries being commanded
by his guns below the palace and on the bridges.</p>

<p>In less than an hour the action was over. The insurgents
fled in all directions, leaving the streets covered with
the dead and wounded. The troops of the Convention
then marched into the various Sections, disarmed the terrified
inhabitants, and before nightfall everything was
quiet. The sun went down as calmly over the
helpless city as though nothing had happened. That same
evening the theatres were opened and illuminated, and
there were general rejoicings on almost every hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Napoleon's star rose that night above the horizon; all
Paris rushed to catch a glimpse of the young commander,
and for many years afterwards France continued to look
to him for protection,&mdash;and not in vain.</p>

<p>On the night of the 13th Vendemiaire Napoleon wrote
to his brother Joseph, saying: "At last all is finished
and I hasten to send you news of myself. The Royalists,
formed into Sections, were becoming daily more threatening.
The Convention gave orders for the disarmament of
the Lepelletier Section which resisted the troops. Menou,
who commanded, was, it is said, a traitor, and was immediately
disgraced. The Convention appointed Barras to
command the armed forces; the committee named me to
command them under him. We placed our troops;
the enemy came to attack us at the Tuileries. We killed
many of them, and lost thirty killed and sixty wounded of
our men. We have disarmed the Sections, and all is peace
again. As usual I am unhurt. P.S. Fortune is on my
side. Love to Eugenie and Julie."</p>

<p>Within five days from the defeat of the Sections Napoleon
was named second in command of the Army of the
Interior, and shortly afterwards Barras, finding his duties
as director sufficient to occupy his time, gave up the command
to his "little Corsican officer."</p>

<p>After his inauguration as general of the armed force of
Paris, Bonaparte waited on each of the five directors.
While on a visit to Carnot a celebrated writer was there by
invitation,&mdash;it being presentation day,&mdash;and as the young
commander entered, was singing at the piano forte accompanied
by a young lady. The entrance of Napoleon, then
a short, well-made, olive-complexioned youth, amidst five
or six tall young men who seemed to pay him the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
attention, was a very surprising contrast, and made something
of a stir.</p>

<p>On Bonaparte's entrance Carnot bowed with an air of
perfect ease and self-possession, and as he passed by the
author the latter inquired of the host who the gentlemen
were.</p>

<p>The director answered: "The general of the armed force
of Paris and his aides-de-camp."</p>

<p>"What is his name?" said the author.</p>

<p>"Bonaparte."</p>

<p>"Has he any military skill?"</p>

<p>"So it is said."</p>

<p>"What has he ever done to render himself conspicuous?"</p>

<p>"He is the officer who commanded the troops of the
Convention on the Thirteenth Vendemiaire." (Day of
the defeat of the Sections).</p>

<p>A shade passed over the visage of the inquirer, who
happened to be one of the electors of the Vendemiaire, and
he retired to one of the dark corners to observe the new
visitor in thoughtfulness and in silence. Carnot then took
occasion to predict that the young general would soon take
another step to fame and glory.</p>

<p>It was about this time that a lady asked Napoleon:
"How could you fire thus mercilessly upon your countrymen?"</p>

<p>"A soldier," he replied calmly, "is only a machine to
obey orders!"</p>

<p>A few years before, while at a party given in the drawing
rooms of M. Neckar, a celebrated financier, the Bishop
of Autun commended Fox and Sheridan for having
asserted that the French army, by refusing to obey the orders
of their superiors to fire upon the populace, had set a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
glorious example to all the armies of Europe; because, by
so doing, they had shown themselves that men, by becoming
soldiers, did not cease to be citizens.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bonaparte at the Bridge of Arcola</span></div>
</div>

<p>"Excuse me, if I venture to interrupt you;" said
Napoleon quickly, "but as I am an officer, I must claim
the privilege of expressing my sentiments. I sincerely
believe that a strict discipline in the army is absolutely
necessary for the safety of our constitutional government
and for the maintenance of order. Nay, if our troops are
not compelled unhesitatingly to obey the commands of
the executive, we shall be exposed to the blind fury of
democratic passions which will render France the most
miserable country on the globe!"</p>

<p>The action of the Assembly in placing Napoleon in
command of the troops in Paris had caused his name to
appear frequently in the newspapers, and thenceforth it
emerged from obscurity. As commander his first act was
to intercede for and gain the acquittal of Menou, his predecessor,
who was then in prison, principally because of his
failure to put down the rioters.</p>

<p>Bonaparte now began to hold military levees, at one of
which an incident occurred which gave at once a new
turn in his mode of life, and a fresh impetus to the advance
of his fortunes. A beautiful boy about twelve years old
appeared before Napoleon and said: "My name is Eugene
Beauharnais. My father, Viscount, and a General
of the Republican armies, has died on the guillotine, and
I am come to pray you, sir, to give me his sword." Bonaparte
caused the request to be complied with, and the tears
of the boy, as he received and kissed the relic, excited the
commander's interest. The next day the youth's mother,
Josephine Beauharnais, came to thank Napoleon for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
kind treatment of her son, and her beauty and singular
gracefulness of address made a strong impression
upon him. Some time later he offered Josephine his
hand; she, after some hesitation, accepted it, and the
young general by his marriage, which was celebrated on
March 5th, 1796, thus cemented his favorable connection
with the society of the Luxembourg, and in particular, with
Tallien and Barras, at that time the most powerful men
in France.</p>

<p>The first meeting with Eugene, and its influence upon
Napoleon's marriage with Josephine, has been sometimes
questioned by historians, many of whom have seemingly
neglected the Exile's own verification of the story at St.
Helena, in which, after relating the incident of Josephine's
visit, he said to Dr. O'Meara: "I was much struck with
her appearance (Josephine's), and still more with her
<i>esprit</i>. This first impression was daily strengthened, and
marriage was not long in following."</p>

<p>Tranquility was now restored in Paris, and the Directors
had leisure to turn their attention to the affairs of the Army
of Italy, which was then in a most confused and unsatisfactory
condition. They determined to place it under it a
new general, and Bonaparte, then but twenty-six years of
age, was appointed to the command of the Army of Italy.
It is said that when the command was given Napoleon by
Carnot (grandfather of the late Sadi-Carnot, president of
the present French Republic), the latter told him it was
to the command of men alone that he could be appointed,
the troops being destitute of everything but arms. Bonaparte
replied, that provided he would let him have men
enough, that it was all he wanted; he would answer for the
rest, a promise that was soon fulfilled, for instead of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
army wanting everything, it became, at the enemy's expense,
one of the best appointed in Europe.</p>

<p>It was afterwards a matter of dispute between Carnot
and Barras as to which of them had first proposed his
appointment to this command. It is admitted in one of
Josephine's letters that Barras had promised to procure the
position for Bonaparte before his marriage took place.</p>

<p>One of the Directors hesitated and said to Napoleon,
"You are too young."</p>

<p>"In a year," he answered, "I shall be either old or
dead!"</p>

BONAPARTE'S CAMPAIGN IN ITALY, 1796-7</h2>

<p class="p2">When Napoleon set out from Paris on the 21st of March
1796, to take command of the Army of Italy, after a
honeymoon of but three days, he traversed France with
the swiftness of a courier, turning aside but a few hours
at Marseilles with his mother and family, whom he was
now able to provide for in an adequate manner. His
letters to Josephine were full of passionate expressions of
tenderness, and regret at their separation. But after paying
his tribute to the affections, his heart was speedily filled
with exultation and triumph. For the first time he was
chief in command; the power within him was now free to
direct his actions, unhampered by the restraint he had so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
long felt in the capital. He was extremely anxious to
commence the career to which Fate called him, by placing
himself at the head of the Army of Italy at once.</p>

<p>It would not be difficult to imagine with what delight
this young general&mdash;then scarcely twenty-six years old&mdash;advanced
to an independent field of glory and conquest,
confident in his own powers, and in the perfect knowledge
of the country which he had previously acquired. He
had under his command such men, already distinguished
in war by success and bravery as: Augereau, Massena,
Serrurier, Joubert, Lannes, Murat, La Harpe, Stengel and
Kilmaine, all of whom were astonished at the youthful
appearance of their new commander.</p>

<p>It was not without some discontent that the old generals
beheld a young man, lately their inferior, taking the command
over their heads,&mdash;to which each supposed he had a
prior claim, and reaping the benefits of a plan of operations
they did not imagine to have originated with himself. As
he rode along the ranks the soldiers observed that he did
not sit well on horseback, and complained that a "mere
boy" had been sent to command them. The young
general, however, soon obtained that respect for his
character, which had been denied to his physical constitution.
The firmness he exhibited, soon put a stop to the
insubordination which had prevailed in the army; and,
even before they had conquered under him, the troops
became as submissive as at any subsequent period, when
his character was fully established.</p>

<p>Some years before, when Bonaparte was conversing at
Toulon with M. de Volney, the well-known Corsican
traveler and literary man, at a dinner given to the two
friends by Turreau, then in command of the military force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
at Nice, a campaign in Italy was suggested. After the
dessert was brought in Napoleon said to Turreau: "Don't
you think it's altogether too bad to have 10,000 men lying
idle here at Nice when the Republic could make such
excellent use of them in Italy?"</p>

<p>"Possibly," replied Turreau, "but we can do nothing;
we have no order to move from the Committee of Public
Safety."</p>

<p>"Then," said Napoleon, "it is your duty to make the
committee ashamed of its inactivity."</p>

<p>"What would you do if you could act as you pleased?"
asked Turreau. Napoleon promised to give a reply the
next evening. At the time fixed he came prepared with
a complete plan of campaign written out and classified
under seventeen heads. It involved the invasion and
conquest of Italy on almost the same lines that he was now
about to undertake, and the outgrowth partially of that
meeting, for Turreau forwarded the plan to the Committee
of Public Safety at Paris on condition that it be put in the
hands of Carnot, in whose judgment Napoleon had confidence.
Carnot looked over the plan and was delighted.
He was unable to secure immediate action, but two years
later, when the invasion of Italy was determined upon, he
had sufficient influence to see that Napoleon was put in
charge of it.</p>

<p>Bonaparte arrived at the headquarters of the army at
Nice on the 27th of March, 1796. The French Army of
Italy, which amounted to 31,000 available men, had endured
great hardships and privations, were destitute of
shoes, clothing, and almost everything which their comfort
demanded. The cavalry was wretchedly mounted and
they were very deficient in artillery. To silence their com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>plaints,
and reconcile them to their situation, as well as to
endear them to himself, Napoleon lived familiarly with his
soldiers, participated in their hardships and privations, and
redressed many of their grievances. "My brave fellows,"
he said to them on one occasion, while endeavoring
to revive their spirits; "although you suffer great privations,
you have no reason to be dissatisfied; everything
yields to power; if we are victorious, the provisions and the
supplies of the enemy become ours; <i>if we are vanquished,
we have already too much to lose</i>."</p>

<p>The allies, Austrian and Sardinian, were a greatly
superior force, numbering as they did 80,000 men, were
well equipped with supplies, and occupied in their own, or
a friendly country, all the heights and passes of the Alps.
Berthier, then on Napoleon's staff as major-general, took
great pleasure in showing as a curiosity in after years a
general order by which three louis-d'or were granted as a
great supply for an outfit to each general of division, and
dated on the very day of the victory at Albinga.</p>

<p>On the 8th of April Napoleon wrote to the Directory:
"I found this army, not only destitute, but without discipline;
their insubordination and discontent were such
that the malcontents had formed a party for the Dauphin,
and were singing songs opposed to the tenets of the Revolution.
You may, however, rest assured that peace and
order will be re-established; by the time you receive this
letter, we shall have come to an engagement."</p>

<p>It was under such circumstances that Bonaparte proposed
forcing a passage to Italy and converting the richest
territory of the enemy into the theatre of war. "Soldiers,"
said he to his destitute and disheartened men,
"you are naked and ill-fed; the Republic owes you much,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
but she has nothing with which to pay her debts. Your
endurance and patience amidst these barren rocks deserves
admiration; but it brings you no glory. I come to lead
you into the most fertile plains the sun shines upon. Rich
provinces, and great cities will soon be in your power;
there you will reap riches and glory&mdash;they will be at
your disposal. Soldiers of Italy! with such a prospect
before you, can you fail in courage and perseverance?"</p>

<p>This was the commander's first address to the army,
and the words of encouragement which he gave them shot
martial enthusiasm through their veins like electric fire.
Under the incompetent management of Scherer the army,
which had obtained some success against the Austrian
general, De Vins, had been without glory, although their
battalions were headed by valiant officers whose leader
had neglected to improve his good fortune. The French
soldiers were thirsting for a commander capable of leading
them on to fame and glory, the conquest of Italy, therefore,
seemed reserved for General Bonaparte.</p>

<p>Napoleon's system of tactics, although then unknown
even to his officers, were a fixity with him. They appear
to have been grounded on the principle that "the commander
will be victorious who assembles the greatest
number of forces upon the same point at the same moment,
notwithstanding an inferiority of numbers to the enemy
when the general force is computed on both sides." He
eminently possessed the power of calculation and combination
necessary to exercise these decisive manoeuvres.</p>

<p>Napoleon's career of victory began, as it continued, in
defiance of the established rules of warfare, and what distinguished
him above all his contemporaries was his ability
to convert the most unfavorable circumstances into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
means of success. He perceived that the time was come for
turning a new leaf in the history of war. With such numbers
of troops as the impoverished Republic could afford him, he
soon saw that no considerable advantages could be obtained
against the vast and highly-disciplined armies of Austria
and her allies unless the established rules of etiquette and
strategy were abandoned. It was only by such rapidity
of motion as should utterly surprise the superior numbers
of his adversaries that he could hope to concentrate the
entire energy of a small force, such as he commanded,
upon some point of a much greater force, and thus defeat
them. He knew he would have to deal with veteran soldiers
and experienced generals&mdash;men who had learned the
art of war before he was born. He therefore resolved that
every movement should be made with celerity, and every
blow be leveled where it was least expected.</p>

<p>To effect such rapid marches as he had determined upon,
it was necessary that the soldiery should make up their
minds to consider tents and baggage as idle luxuries; and
that instead of a long and complicated chain of reserves
and stores, they should dare to rely wholly for the means
of sustenance on the countries into which their venturesome
leader might conduct them.</p>

<p>The objects of Napoleon's expedition were to compel
the king of Sardinia, who maintained a powerful army in
the field, to abandon the alliance of Austria; to compel
Austria to concentrate her forces in her Italian provinces,
thus obliging her to withdraw them from the bank of the
Rhine where they had long hovered. It was hoped, also,
to humble the power of the Vatican and break the prestige
of its Jesuitical diplomacy forever. He had as yet
achieved no fame in the field and not a general in Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
would have blamed him if he had only succeeded in holding
the territory of Nice and Savoy, which France had
already won.</p>

<p>Napoleon's plan of reaching the fair regions of
Italy differed from that of all former conquerors; they had
uniformly penetrated the Alps at some point of access in
that mighty range of mountains; he judged that the same
end might be accomplished more easily by advancing along
the narrow strip of comparatively level country that intervenes
between those enormous barriers and the shores of
the Mediterranean Sea, and forcing a passage at the point
where the last or southern extremity of the Alps melt, as
it were, into the first and lowest of the Appenine range.</p>

<p>No sooner did he begin to concentrate his troops towards
this region than Beaulieu, the Austrian general, took
measures for protecting Genoa and the entrance of Italy
with a powerful, disciplined and well-appointed army.
He posted himself with one column at Voltri, a town on
the sea some ten miles west of Genoa; D'Argenteau, with
another column occupied the heights of Montenotte, while
the Sardinians, led by General Colli, formed the right of
the line at Ceva. This disposition was made in compliance
with the old system of tactics; but it was powerless
before new strategy. The French could not advance
towards Genoa but by confronting some one of the three
armies and these Beaulieu supposed were too strongly
posted to be dislodged.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 12th of April, 1796, when
D'Argenteau advanced from Montenotte to attack the
column of Rampon, he found that by skillful manoeuvres
during the night Napoleon had completely surrounded
him&mdash;a man who had fancied there was nothing new to
be done in warfare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>On the previous day the Austrians had driven in all the
outposts of the French and appeared before the redoubt of
Montenotte. This redoubt, the last of the intrenchments,
was defended by 1,500 men commanded by Rampon who
made his soldiers take an oath, during the heat of the
attack, to defend it or perish in the intrenchments, to
the last man. The repeated assaults of the French were
without avail, their advancement was checked and they
were kept the whole night at the distance of a pistol shot,
400 men being killed by the fire of their musketry alone.</p>

<p>At daybreak, the following morning, Bonaparte then
being at the head of the French forces, and having introduced
two pieces of cannon into the redoubt during the
night, the action was recommenced with great vigor and
with varying success. The contest had continued for
sometime, when Bonaparte, with Berthier and Massena appearing
suddenly with the centre and left wing of the army
upon the rear and flank of the enemy, at once
commenced a furious attack, filled them with terror and
confusion, and decided the fate of the day. D'Argenteau,
who commanded the rear, had fought gallantly, but seeing
that to continue the battle would only end in total destruction,
he fled, leaving his colors and cannon, a thousand
killed and two thousand prisoners.</p>

<p>Thus was the centre of the great Austrian army completely
routed before either its commander-in-chief at the
left, or General Colli at the right, knew that a battle had
begun. It was from this battle, the first of Napoleon's
victories, that the French Emperor told the Emperor of
Austria, some years later, that he dated his nobility.
"Ancestors?" said Napoleon, "I, sir, am an ancestor
myself; my title of nobility dates from Montenotte!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>This victory enabled the French, under La Harpe, to
advance to Cairo, and placed them on that side of the Alps
which slopes toward Lombardy.</p>

<p>Beaulieu now fell back on Dego, where he could open
his communication with Colli, who had retreated to
Millessimo, a small town about nine miles from Dego.
Here the two commanders hoped to unite their forces.
They were soon strongly posted, and dispatching couriers
to Milan for reinforcements, intended to await their
arrival before risking another battle. It was their object
to keep fast in these positions until succor could come
from Lombardy; but Napoleon had no intention of giving
them such a respite; his tactics were not those of other
generals.</p>

<p>The morning after the victory of Montenotte Bonaparte
dispatched Augereau to attack Millessimo; Massena to
fall on Dego, and La Harpe to turn the flank of Beaulieu.</p>

<p>Massena carried the heights of Biestro at the point of the
bayonet, while La Harpe dislodged the Austrian general
from his position, which separated him hopelessly from
the Sardinian commander and put him to precipitate flight.
By these movements Bonaparte was in such a position,
that, though they had not traversed, his army had at all
events scaled the Alps.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Augereau had seized the outposts of Millessimo
and cut off Provera, with 2,000 Austrians who occupied
an eminence upon the mountain of Cossaria, from the main
body of Colli's army. Provera took refuge in a ruined
castle which he defended with great bravery, hoping to
receive assistance from Colli.</p>

<p>The next morning Napoleon, who had arrived in the
night, forced Colli to battle and compelled him to retreat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
towards Ceva. Provera imitated the gallant example of
Colonel Rampon in his defense, but not with the same
success. He was compelled to surrender his sword to
Bonaparte at discretion, after a loss of 10,000 in killed and
prisoners, twenty-two cannon and fifteen standards.
The French found on the summit of the Alps every species
of ammunition and other necessities which the celerity of
their march had prevented them from carrying.</p>

<p>Dego, situated at the summit of the Alps, secured the
entrance of the French into Italy, cut off the communications
between the Austrian and Sardinian armies, and
placed the conqueror in a situation to crush them in
succession one after the other. Beaulieu, fully sensible of
the danger of his situation, collected the best troops in his
army, and at break of day on the 15th of April, retook
Dego at the head of 7,000 men.</p>

<p>The Austrians stood two attacks headed by Napoleon,
but at the third Causse rushed forward, holding his plumed
hat on the point of his sword, and Dego was soon again
in possession of the French. For this piece of gallantry
he immediately received the rank of brigadier-general.
Here also, Lannes, who lived to be a marshal of the
Empire, first attracted the notice of Napoleon, and was
promoted from lieutenant-colonel to colonel. The triumph,
however, was purchased with the life of the brave General
Causse. He was carried out of the mêlée mortally
wounded. Napoleon passed near him as he lay. "Is Dego
retaken?" asked the dying officer. "It is ours," replied
Napoleon. "Then long live the Republic!" cried Causse,
"I die content."</p>

<p>Hotly pursued by the victors, Colli rallied his fugitives
at Mondovi, where they again yielded to the irrisistible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
onset of the French, the Sardinian commander leaving his
best troops, baggage and cannon on the field. The action
was a most severe one in which, among others, the French
general, Stengel, a brave and excellent officer, was killed,
and the cavalry would have been overpowered but for the
desperate valor of Murat.</p>

<p>The Sardinians lost ten stands of colors and fifteen
hundred prisoners, among whom were three generals.
The Sardinian army had now ceased to exist, and the
Austrians were flying to the frontiers of Lombardy.</p>

<p>Napoleon, following up his advantage, entered Cherasco,
a strong place about ten miles from Turin, as a conqueror.
Here he dictated the terms by which the Sardinian king
could still wear a crown. From the castle where he stood,
and looking off on the garden-fields of Lombardy&mdash;which
had gladdened the eyes of so many conquerors&mdash;with the
Alps behind him, glittering in their perennial snows,
Napoleon said to his officers: "Hannibal forced the Alps&mdash;we
have turned them." To his soldiers, whom he
addressed in a proclamation, he said: "In fifteen days
you have gained six victories, taken twenty-one stands of
colors, fifty-five pieces of cannon, several fortresses, and
conquered the richest part of Piedmont: you have made
15,000 prisoners, killed or wounded upwards of 10,000
men. Hitherto you have fought for barren rocks, rendered
famous by your valor, but useless to your country. Your
services now equal those of the victorious army of Holland
and the Rhine. You have provided yourselves with
everything of which you were destitute. You have gained
battles without cannon! passed rivers without bridges!
made forced marches without shoes! bivouacked without
strong liquors and often without bread! Republican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
phalanxes, Soldiers of Liberty, only, could have endured
all this. Thanks for your perseverance! If your conquest
of Toulon presaged the immortal campaign of 1793,
your present victories presage a still nobler. But, soldiers,
you have done nothing while so much remains to be done;
neither Turin or Milan are yours. The ashes of the Conquerors
of the Tarquins are still trampled by the assassins
of Basseville."</p>

<p>To the Italians Napoleon said: "People of Italy! The
French army comes to break your chains. The people of
France are the friends of all nations&mdash;confide in them.
Your property, your religion and your customs shall be
respected. We make war with those tyrants alone who
enslave you."</p>

<p>The French soldiers, flushed with victory, were eager
to continue their march, and the people of Italy hailed
Napoleon as their deliverer. The Sardinian king did not
long survive the humiliation of the loss of his crown&mdash;he
died of a broken heart within a few days after signing
the treaty of Cherasco.</p>

<p>In the meantime the couriers of Napoleon were almost
every hour riding into Paris with the news of his victories,
and five times in six days the Representatives of France
had decreed that the Army of Italy deserved well of their
country.</p>

<p>Murat was sent to Paris bearing the news of the capitulation
of the king of Sardinia, and twenty-one stands of
colors. His arrival caused great joy in the capital.</p>

<p>The consummate genius of this brief campaign could
not be disputed, and the modest language of the young
general's dispatches to the Directory lent additional grace
to his fame. All the eyes of Europe were fixed in admiration
on his career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>In less than a month's campaign Napoleon laid the
gates of Italy open before him; reduced the Austrians to
inaction; utterly destroyed the Sardinian king's army,
and took two great fortresses called "the keys to the
Alps!"</p>

<p>To effect the rapid movements required for such results,
everything was sacrificed that came in the way, not only
on this occasion, but on every other. Baggage, stragglers,
the wounded, the artillery&mdash;all were left behind, rather
than the column should fail to reach the destined place at
the destined time. Napoleon made no allowance for
accidents or impediments. Things until now reckoned
essential to an army were dispensed with; and, for the
first time, troops were seen to take the field without tents,
camp equipage, magazines of provisions, and military
hospitals. Such a system naturally aggravated the
horrors of war. The soldiers were, necessarily, marauders,
and committed terrible excesses at this first stage of the
campaign; but every effort was made, and with much
success, to prevent this evil after conquest had put the
means of regular supply within the power of the commander-in-chief.
The wounded were frequently left
behind for want of the means of conveyance. According
to one authority, the loss by the disorders inseparable
from this means of war was four times as great as by the
fire or the sword of the enemy.</p>

<p>The army, nevertheless, adored its fortunate general,
and it still doted upon him even when undeceived respecting
his providence for it. "To be able to solve this
enigma," says General Foy, "it was requisite to have
known Napoleon, the life of camp and of glory, and,
above all, one must have a French head and heart."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
With the sufferings of the army, he never failed to show
an active sympathy when it did not tend to the compromise
of his plans. The hours, too, spent by Napoleon on
the field after a battle, endeared him to his followers.
He visited the hospitals in person and made his officers,
after his example, take the utmost interest in this duty.
His hand was applied to the wounds; his voice cheered
the sick. All who recovered could relate individual acts
of kindness experienced from him by themselves or their
comrades.</p>

<p>It was at this period that a medal of Napoleon was
struck at Paris as conqueror of Montenotte. The face
is extremely thin, with long, straight hair. On the
reverse, a figure of Victory is represented flying over the
Alps, bearing a palm branch, a wreath of laurel and a
drawn sword. It was the first of the splendid series
designed by Denon to record the victories and honors of
France's great warrior.</p>

<p>Napoleon determined to advance without delay, giving
Tuscany, Venice, and the other Italian States no time to
take up a hostile attitude. After accomplishing so much,
a general of less enterprise might have thought it right to
rest awhile and wait for reinforcements before attempting
further conquest, but not so with Napoleon. The French
army, to which recruits were now flocking from every
hospital and depot within reach, was ordered to prepare
for instant motion.</p>

<p>It was after one of the successful movements of this period
that an old Hungarian officer was brought prisoner to
Bonaparte, who entered into conversation with him, and
among other matters asked what he thought of the state
of the war. "Nothing," replied the prisoner, who did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
not know he was addressing the commander-in-chief,
"nothing can be worse. Here is a young man who knows
absolutely nothing of the regular rules of war; to-day he
is in our rear, to-morrow on our flank, the next day again
in our front. Such violations of the principles of the art
of war are intolerable sir, and we do not know how to
proceed!"</p>

</div>

<p>To secure the route to Milan it was necessary to drive
the Austrians from the banks of the Adda, behind which
they had retired after a heavy loss at Fombio. Lannes
upon that occasion gave proofs of his astonishing intrepidity;
at the head of a single battalion, he attacked
between seven and eight thousand Austrians, and not
content in causing their flight, he pursued them ten miles,
following the trot of their cavalry on foot.</p>

<p>Having collected an immense quantity of artillery and
the main division of his army at a narrow wooden bridge
erected across this stream at the town of Lodi, General
Beaulieu awaited the arrival of the French, confident of
defending the passage of the Adda and arresting their
progress. Beaulieu had placed a battery of thirty cannon
so as to completely sweep every plank of the bridge.
Had he removed the structure, which was about 500 feet
in length, when he changed his headquarters to the east
bank of the river, he might have made the passage much
more formidable than even his cannon made it.</p>

<p>Well aware that his conquest would never be consolidated
till the Austrian army was totally vanquished, and
deprived of all its Italian possessions, Bonaparte hastened
to pursue the enemy to Lodi. Coming up on the 10th of
May, he easily drove the rear-guard of the Austrian army
before him into the town, but found his further progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
threatened by the tremendous fire of thirty cannon stationed
at the opposite end of the bridge so as to sweep it completely.
The whole body of the enemy's infantry drawn
up in a dense line, supported this appalling disposition of
the artillery.</p>

<p>Bonaparte's first care was to place as many guns as he
could get in direct opposition to the Austrian battery.
He was determined that no obstacle should oppose his
victorious career, and at once resolved to pass the bridge.</p>

<p>Exposed to a shower of grape-shot from the enemy's
batteries, Napoleon at last succeeded in planting two
pieces of cannon at the head of the bridge on the French
side, and to prevent the enemy from destroying it a column
was immediately formed from the troops that at once
appeared, determined to carry the pass. The French now
commenced a fearful cannonading. Bonaparte himself
appeared in the midst of the fire, pointing with his own
hand two guns in such a manner as to cut off the Austrians
from the only path by which they could have
advanced to undermine the bridge.</p>

<p>Observing, meanwhile, that Beaulieu had removed his
infantry to a considerable distance backwards, to keep
them out of the range of the French battery, Napoleon
instantly detached General Beaumont and his cavalry,
with orders to gallop out of sight, ford the river,
and coming suddenly upon the enemy, attack them in the
rear. When that took place Napoleon instantly drew up
a body of 3,000 grenadiers in close column under the
shelter of the houses, and bade them prepare for the
desperate attempt of forcing a passage across the narrow
bridge, in the face of the enemy's thickly-planted
artillery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>A sudden movement in the flanks of the enemy now
convinced Napoleon that his cavalry had arrived and
charged the enemy's flank, and he instantly gave the
word. In a moment the brave grenadiers wheeled to the
left and were at once upon the bridge, rushing forward at
a charge step, and shouting: "Vive la République!";
but the storm of grape-shot from the enemy's guns checked
them for a moment. It was a very sepulchre of death and
a burning furnace of destruction pouring out its broadsides
of fire in defense of its position; a hundred brave men
fell dead. The advancing column faltered under the
redoubled roar of the guns and the rattle of grape-shot.</p>

<p>Lannes, Napoleon, Berthier and L'Allemand now hurried
to the front, rallied and cheered the men, and as the column
dashed across and over the dead bodies of the slain which
covered the passageway, and in the face of a tempest of
fire that thinned their ranks at every step, the leaders
shouted: "Follow your generals, my brave fellows!"</p>

<p>Lannes was the first to reach the other side, Napoleon
himself being second.</p>

<p>The Austrian artillerymen were bayoneted at their guns
before the other troops, whom Beaulieu had removed too
far back in his anxiety to avoid the French battery, could
come to their assistance. Beaumont pressing gallantly
with his horse upon the flank, and Napoleon's infantry
forming rapidly as they passed the bridge, and charging
on the instant, the Austrian line at once became involved
in inextricable confusion. The contest was almost
instantly decided; the whole line of Austrian artillery was
carried; their order of battle broken; their troops routed
and put to flight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The slaughter of Austrians amounted to vast numbers,
while the French lost but 200 men. Thus did Bonaparte
execute with such rapidity and consequently with so little
loss "the terrible passage," as he himself called it, "of
the bridge of Lodi." It is justly called one of the most
daring achievements on record.</p>

<p>The victory of Lodi had a great influence on Napoleon's
mind. He declared subsequently that neither his success
in quelling the "Sections," nor his victory at Montenotte,
made him regard himself as anything superior; but that
after Lodi, for the first time the idea dawned upon him
that he would one day be "a decisive actor," as he himself
put it, on the stage of the military and political world.
That he was a fatalist is well-known, it being a frequent
expression with him that "every bullet is marked."</p>

<p>On this occasion the soldiers conferred on him the nick-name
of "Little Corporal." The original cause of the
appellation, as applied to Bonaparte, has been related by
Napoleon himself. He says that when he commanded
near the Col di Tende the army was obliged to traverse a
narrow bridge, on which occasion he gave directions that
no women should be allowed to accompany it, as the
service was particularly difficult, and required that the
troops should be continually on the alert; to enforce
such an order he placed two captains on the bridge with
instructions, on pain of death, not to permit a woman to
pass. He subsequently repaired to the bridge himself, for
the purpose of ascertaining whether his orders were being
scrupulously obeyed, when he found a crowd of women
assembled, who, as soon as they saw him, began to revile
him, exclaiming: "Oh, then, <i>petit corporal</i>, it is you who
have given orders not to let us pass!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Some miles in advance Napoleon was surprised to see a
considerable number of women with the troops. He
immediately ordered the two captains to be put under
arrest and brought before him, intending to have them
tried immediately. They protested their innocence,
asserting that no women had crossed the bridge. Bonaparte
caused some of the females to be brought before
him, and learned with astonishment, from their own
confession, that they had emptied some casks of provisions
and concealed themselves therein, by which means they
had passed over unperceived.</p>

<p>After every battle the oldest soldiers convened a council
in order to confer a new rank on their young general,
who, on making his appearance, was saluted by his latest
title. Bonaparte, therefore, was nominated <i>corporal</i> at
Lodi, and <i>sergeant</i> at Castiglione. It was "Little Corporal,"
however, that the soldiery constantly applied to him ever
afterwards.</p>

<p>The fruits of this splendid victory at Lodi were twenty
pieces of cannon, and between two and three thousand
killed, wounded and prisoners, and the loss by the enemy
of an excellent line of defense.</p>

<p>When Europe heard of the battle they named the conqueror
"The Hero of Lodi."</p>

<p>Beaulieu contrived to withdraw a part of his troops,
and gathering the scattered fragment of his force together,
soon threw the line of the Mincio, a tributary of the Po,
between himself and his enemy. The great object, however,
he had attained,&mdash;he was still free to defend Mantua.</p>

<p>The French following up their advantages at Lodi,
pursued the Austrians with great celerity. They advanced
to Pizzighitone, which immediately surrendered. Push<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>ing
on to Cremona they met with like success, and the
vanguard, having taken the route to Milan, entered this
city on the 14th of May, having on their march received
the submission of Pavia, where they found most of the
magazines of the Austrian army. The tri-colored flag
now waved in triumph from the extremity of the Lake of
Como and the frontiers of the country to the gates of
Parma.</p>

<p>The Austrians having evacuated Milan, when the French
prepared to enter it, a deputation of the inhabitants laid
the keys of its gates at their feet. A few days later,
although the archduke had fled from his capital, overwhelmed
with sorrow and mortification, the people collected
in vast multitudes to witness the entry of the French,
whom they hailed as their deliverers. The imperial arms
were taken down from the public buildings and at the
ducal palace this humorous advertisement was posted up:</p>

<div class="dotbox">
"<span class="smcap">A House to Rent.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Inquire for the keys at</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;" class="smcap">Citizen Salicetti's</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The French Commissioner."</span><br />
</div>

<p>The entry of Bonaparte into Milan under a triumphal
arch and surrounded by the grenadiers of Lodi, among
whom some generals were conspicuous, was eminently
brilliant. The splendid carriages of the nobility and
aristocracy of the capital went out to meet and salute him
as the "Deliverer of Italy," and returned in an immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
cavalcade, amidst the shouts and acclamations of an innumerable
multitude, and accompanied by several bands playing
patriotic marches, the procession stopping at the palace
of the archduke, where Bonaparte was to take up his
headquarters. The ceremonies of the day were concluded
by a splendid ball at which the ladies showed their Republican
feeling by wearing the French national colors in
every part of their dress. On the same day Bonaparte
entered Milan the treaty with the king of Sardinia and
the Directory was signed at Paris.</p>

<p>Napoleon now addressed himself again to his soldiers,
reminding them of their victories and responsibilities yet
to come. "To you, soldiers," he said, "will belong the
immortal honor of redeeming the fairest portion of Europe.
The French people, free and respected by the whole world,
shall give to Europe a glorious peace, which shall indemnify
it for all the sacrifices it has borne the last six years.
Then by your own firesides you shall repose, and your
fellow-citizens, when they point out any one of you, shall
say: <span class="smcap">'He belonged to the Army of Italy!</span>'"</p>

<p>From that period the Army of Italy was no longer a tax
upon France, but on the contrary was a great source of
revenue to her, and assisted in paying her other armies. Six
weeks after the opening of the campaign, independent of
ten million of francs placed at the disposal of the Directory,
Bonaparte sent upwards of two hundred thousand francs
to the Army of the Alps, and a million to the Army of the
Rhine, thereby paving the way to his future greatness.</p>

<p>Bonaparte remained but six days in Milan; he then
proceeded to pursue Beaulieu, who had planted the remains
of his army behind the Mincio. The Austrian general
had placed his left on the great and strong city of Mantua,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
which had been termed "the citadel of Italy," and his
right at Peschiera, a well-known Venetian fortress. The
Austrian veteran occupied one of the strongest positions
that it is possible to imagine, and Bonaparte hastened once
more to dislodge him.</p>

<p>The French Directory, meanwhile, had begun to entertain
suspicion as to the ultimate designs of their young
general, whose success and rising fame had already reached
so astonishing a height. That they were exceedingly
jealous of him there seems to be no doubt, and they determined
to check, if they could, the career of a man of whom
they seemed to be in fear. Bonaparte was therefore ordered
to take half his army and lead it against the pope and the
king of Naples, and leave the other half to terminate the
conquest with Beaulieu at Mantua, under the orders of
Kellerman. He answered by offering to resign his command.
"One half of the Army of Italy cannot suffice to
finish the matter with the Austrians," said he. "It is
only by keeping my force entire that I have been able to
gain so many battles and to be now in Milan. You had
better have one bad general than two good ones!"</p>

<p>The Directory did not dare to persist in displacing the
chief whose name was considered as the pledge of victory,
and he continued to assume the entire command of the
Army of Italy.</p>

<p>Another unlooked-for occurrence delayed for a few days
the march upon Mantua. The success of the French and
their exactions where victorious, had fostered the ire of a
portion of the populace throughout Lombardy. Reports
of new Austrian levies being poured down the passes of
Tyrol were spread and believed. Insurrections against
the conqueror now took place in various districts, placing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
thirty thousand men in arms. At Pavia the insurgents
were entirely triumphant; they seized the town and compelled
the French garrison to surrender. This flame, had
it been suffered to spread, threatened immeasurable evil
to the French cause.</p>

<p>Lannes instantly marched to Binasco, stormed the place,
burnt it and put many of the insurgents to the sword.
Napoleon appeared before Pavia, blew the gates open, took
possession and later caused the leaders to be executed.
At Lugo, where another insurrection took place, the
leaders were tried by court martial and condemned.</p>

<p>These examples quelled the insurrectionists, and the
French advanced on the Mincio. Bonaparte made such
disposition of his troops that Beaulieu believed he meant to
cross that river, if he could, at Peschiera. Meanwhile the
French had been preparing to cross at another point, and
on the 30th of May actually forced the passage of the
Mincio, not at Peschiera, but further down at Borghetto.
The Austrian garrison at this point in vain destroyed one
arch of the bridge. Bonaparte quickly supplied the breach
with planks, and his men, flushed with so many victories,
charged with a fury not to be resisted. While the French
were laboring to repair the bridge, under the fire of the
enemy's batteries, impatient of delay, fifty grenadiers
threw themselves into the river, holding their muskets
over their heads with the water up to their chins, General
Gardanne, a grenadier in courage as well as in stature,
being at their head. The Austrians who were nearest,
recollecting the terrible column at Lodi, fled. When the
bridge was repaired the French entered Vallegio, where
Beaulieu's headquarters had been stationed a short time
previous. The latter was obliged to abandon the Mincio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
as he had the Adda and the Po, and to take up the new
line of the Adige.</p>

<p>The left line of the Austrian force, learning from the
cannonade that the French were at Borghetto, hastened to
ascend the Mincio with a view of assisting in the defense
of the division engaged with the enemy. They arrived
too late, however, to be of assistance, as the commander
at Borghetto had retreated before they arrived. They
came, however, unexpectedly, and at a moment when
Bonaparte and a few friends, believing the work of the
day to be over and the village safe from the enemy, were
about to sit down to dinner, as they thought, in security.
Sebetendorff, who commanded the division, came up rapidly
into the village, but with no idea what a prize was
within his grasp. Bonaparte's attendants had barely time
to shut the gates of the inn, and alarm their chief by the
cry, "To arms!" They defended the house with obstinate
courage while Bonaparte threw himself on horseback
and galloping out by a back passage, effected the narrowest
of escapes, proceeding at full speed to join Massena's
forces.</p>

<p>It was shortly after this that Bonaparte met with an
experience that gave him the idea of the "Imperial Guard
of Napoleon" and which throughout his military career
he ever afterwards maintained as a personal guard. It
was the duty of this body, consisting of veterans who
should number at least ten years of active service, to
remain always near the person of the commander-in-chief,
and who were only brought into action when important
movements or desperate emergencies required their utmost
energies. They were placed under the command of
Bessieres at this time, and were known as "Le Corps de
Guides."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>During the same campaign Bonaparte again narrowly
escaped being taken a prisoner. Wurmser, who had been
compelled to throw himself into Mantua, having suddenly
debouched on an open plain, learned from an old woman
that not many minutes before the French general, with
only a few followers, had stopped at her door and fled at
the sight of the Austrians. Wurmser immediately dispatched
parties of cavalry in all directions to whom he
gave orders that if they came up with Napoleon he should
not be killed or harmed; fortunately, however, for the
French commander, destiny and the swiftness of his horse
saved him.</p>

<p>In their different engagements, the grenadiers had
learned to laugh and sport at death; they despised the
Austrian cavalry and nothing could equal their intrepidity
but the gaiety with which they performed their forced
marches, singing alternately songs in praise of their country
and of love. Instead of sleeping they amused themselves
during most of the night, each telling a tale, or
forming his own plans of operation for the following
day.</p>

<p>Sebetendorff was soon assaulted by a French column and
retreated, after Beaulieu's example, on the line of the
Adige. The Austrian commander had, in effect, abandoned
for a time the open country of Italy. He now lay
on the frontier, between the vast tract of rich province,
which Napoleon had conquered, and the Tyrol. Mantua,
which possessed immense natural advantages, and into
which the retreating general had flung a garrison of full
fourteen thousand men, was, in truth, the last and only
Italian possession of the imperial crown, which, as it
seemed, there might be a possibility of saving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Beaulieu anxiously awaited the approach of new troops
from Germany, to attempt the relief of this great city;
and Bonaparte, eager to anticipate the efforts of the
imperial government, sat down immediately before it.</p>

<p>Mantua lies on an island, being cut off on all sides from
the main land by the branches of the Mincio, and approachable
only by five narrow causeways of which three were
now defended by strong and regular fortresses or intrenched
camps; the other two by gates, drawbridge and batteries.
The garrison was prepared to maintain the position, was
well-nigh impregnable and the occupants awaited the hour
to discover whether Napoleon possessed any new system
of attack capable of shortening the usual operations of a
siege as effectually as he had already done by the march
and the battle.</p>

<p>It was a matter of high importance that Napoleon
should reduce this place quickly, for a large army under
Field-Marshal Wurmser, one of the most able and experienced
of the Austrian generals, was about to enter Italy.
His commencement gave cause for much alarm to those
within the fortress. Of the five causeways, by sudden
and overwhelming assaults, he obtained four; the garrison
was cut off from the main land except at the fifth causeway,
the strongest of them all, named from a palace near
it, "La Favorita." It seemed necessary, however, in
order that this blockade might be complete, that the Venetian
territory, lying immediately behind Mantua, should
be occupied by the French, and the claim of neutrality
was not allowed to interfere with Napoleon's plans.</p>

<p>"You are too weak," said Bonaparte, when a Venetian
envoy reached his headquarters, "to enforce neutrality
on hostile nations such as France and Austria. Beaulieu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
did not respect your territory when his interest bade him
violate it; nor shall I hesitate to occupy whatever falls
within the line of the Adige."</p>

<p>Garrisons were placed forthwith in Verona and all the
strong places of that domain. Napoleon now returned to
Milan to transact important business, leaving Serrurier
and Vaubois to blockade Mantua.</p>

<p>The king of Naples, utterly confounded by the success
of the French, was now anxious to secure peace on whatever
terms proposed, and Bonaparte, knowing that it
would result in a withdrawal of some valuable divisions
from the army of Beaulieu, arranged an armistice which
was soon followed by a formal peace, and the Neapolitan
troops, abandoning the Austrian general, began their
march to the south of Italy. This was followed by
peace arrangements with the Pope of whom Napoleon
demanded, and obtained, as a price of the
brief respite from invasion, a million sterling, one
hundred of the finest pictures and statues in the papal
gallery, a large supply of military stores and the cession
of Ancona, Ferrara and Bologna, with their respective
domains. The siege of the citadel of Milan, rigorously
pressed, was at length successful. The garrison capitulated
on the 29th of June, and by the 18th of July, one
hundred and forty pieces of cannon were before Mantua.</p>

<p>The French general had stripped Austria of all her
Italian possessions except Mantua, and the tri-color was
waving from the Tyrol to the Mediterranean. Napoleon
was now, in effect, master of Italy. Future success seemed
to him to be assured, although the French Directory was
with difficulty persuaded to let him follow the course he
had adopted for himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The cabinet of Vienna at last resolved upon sending
stronger reinforcements to the Italian frontier, and Bonaparte
was now recalled from Milan to the seat of war to
defend himself against them. What the Austrian court
now feared was that Napoleon, who had already annihilated
her Italian army, and had wrested from her the
Italian domains, would soon march into the heart
of her Empire and dictate a peace under the walls of
her capital. All Italy was now subdued or in alliance
with the French Republic except Mantua.</p>

<p>Beaulieu, who had been so thoroughly routed by Napoleon,
was to be no longer trusted. Finding himself
incompetent to withstand a general "whose mistress was
glory and whose companion was Plutarch" while traversing
the Tyrol with the wrecks of his army, forwarded a
letter to Vienna which fully displayed the irritated feelings
of the veteran commander at this time. He said: "I
hereby make known to you that I have only 20,000 men
remaining, while the enemy's forces exceed 60,000. I
further apprise you, that it is my intention to retreat
to-morrow,&mdash;the next day&mdash;the day following&mdash;nay, every
day,&mdash;even to Siberia, should they pursue me so far. My
age accords me liberty to be thus explicit. Hasten to
ratify peace, be the conditions what they may!" Wurmser,
whose reputation was of the best, and who was older than
Beaulieu but not less obstinate, was sent to replace him,
and 30,000 men were drafted from the armies on the
Rhine charged with restoring the fortunes of Austria
beyond the Alps. Wurmser's orders, too, were to
strengthen himself, on his march, by whatever recruits he
could raise among the warlike and loyal population of
the Tyrol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>When he fixed his headquarters at Trent, Wurmser
mustered in all 80,000 men, while Napoleon had but
30,000&mdash;not 60,000 as Beaulieu had stated&mdash;to hold a
wide country in which abhorrence of the French
cause was now prevalent, to keep the blockade of
Mantua, and to oppose this fearful odds of numbers in the
field. The French commander was now, moreover, to
act on the defensive, while his adversary assumed the more
inspiriting character of the invader.</p>

<p>Wurmser was unwise enough to divide his magnificent
army into three separate columns, which, united, Napoleon
never could have met; but each of which was soon successively
broken and captured. Melas with the left wing was to
march down the Adige and expel the French from Verona;
Quasdonowich with the right wing followed the valley of
the Chiese towards Brescia, to cut off Napoleon's retreat
on Milan; Wurmser himself led the centre down the left
shore of Lake Guarda towards the besieged castle of
Mantua.</p>

<p>The eye of Napoleon, who had hitherto been watching
with the intensity of an eagle's gaze all the movements of
his antagonist, now saw the division of Quasdonowich separated
from the centre and left wing, and he flew to the
encounter, although he was obliged to draw off his army
from the siege of Mantua, something which very few generals
would have done. On the night of July 31st, he
buried his cannon in the trenches and intentionally marked
his retreat with every sign of precipitation and alarm.
Before morning the whole French army had disappeared
from Mantua and by a forced march regained possession
of Brescia. Napoleon was hurrying forward to attack the
right wing of the Austrian army before it could effect a
junction with the central body of Wurmser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>A courier could hardly have borne to Quasdonowich
the news of his raising the siege of Mantua before Napoleon
had attacked and overwhelmed him, and he was glad to
save his shattered forces by falling back on the Tyrol.</p>

<p>This ill-omened beginning aroused the ire, and quickened
the evolutions of Wurmser, and falling on the rear-guard
of Massena under Pigeon, and Augereau under
Vallette, the one abandoned Castiglione and the other
retired on Lonato. These inconsiderable Austrian successes
were obtained by good generalship, and Wurmser
now attempted to open a communication with his defeated
lieutenant. His columns were weakened by extending
the line, and Massena at once hurled two strong columns
on Lonato, retaking it, and throwing the Austrian forces
into utter confusion.</p>

<p>The battle of Lonato occurred on the 3d of August
(1796). At daybreak the whole of the French army was
in motion, Augereau moving with the right wing towards
Castiglione. General Pigeon, who commanded the French
advance guard, was taken prisoner with three pieces of
cannon; when, at the moment the Austrians were extending
their line, Napoleon sent forward in close columns the
18th and 32d demi-brigades, which being supported by a
strong reserve, broke the enemy's line of battle. The
artillery and prisoners made under General Pigeon, were
thus retaken, and the French entered Lonato.</p>

<p>At Castiglione a firm stand was again taken by the
fleeing Austrians, but Augereau forced the position against
a defense double in numbers and for which he was afterward
created Duke of Castiglione in memory of his exploit.</p>

<p>On that day the Austrians lost twenty pieces of cannon,
from three to four thousand men killed and wounded, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
four thousand prisoners, among whom were three generals.
Before this engagement Napoleon suddenly found himself
placed between two armies each of which was more numerous
than his own. In this situation of affairs, no one of
his generals entertained the least hope; but what was the
astonishment of the soldiers, when they first assembled in
presence of their chief, to observe no alteration in his
countenance. "Fear nothing," said the commander to
them, "show that you remain unchanged; preserve your
valor, your just pride, and the remembrance of your
triumphs; in three days we shall retake all that we have
lost. Rely on me! You know whether or not I am in
the habit of keeping my word."</p>

</div>

<p>In this memorable battle Napoleon raised himself to an
equality with the greatest generals. Although the position
in which he was placed was critical to an eminent
degree, he contrived to turn all the success gained by
Wurmser to the advantage of the French army, and that
by the mere strength of his genius alone. Junot distinguished
himself by extraordinary efforts of courage in
these actions. He was thus mentioned in the dispatch
sent by Napoleon to the Directory after the victory: "I
ordered my aide-de-camp, General-of-Brigade Junot, to
put himself at the head of my company of Guides to pursue
the enemy and overtake him by great speed at Dezenzano.
He encountered Colonel Bender with a party of his
regiment of hussars, whom he charged; but Junot, not
wishing to waste his time by charging the rear, made a
detour on the right, took the regiment in front,&mdash;wounded
the colonel whom he attempted to take prisoner when he
was himself surrounded,&mdash;and after having killed six of
the enemy with his own hand, was cut down and thrown
into a ditch."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The Austrians, still able to collect 25,000 men and a
numerous cavalry, now fled again in all directions upon
the Mincio where Wurmser himself, meanwhile, had been
employed in revictualling Mantua. When Wurmser
reached this point he was utterly astounded to find the
trenches abandoned and no enemy to oppose. One of the
defeated Austrian divisions wandering about without
method in anxiety to find their commander or any part of
his army that was still in the field, came suddenly on
Lonato, the scene of the recent battle, and at a moment
when Napoleon was there with only his staff and Guard
about him. He was not aware that any considerable
body of the enemy remained in the neighborhood, and
but for his great presence of mind must have been taken
prisoner. As it was, he turned his critical position into
an advantage. The officer who had been sent to demand
the surrender of the town was brought blindfolded, according
to custom on such occasions, to his headquarters.
Bonaparte, by a secret sign, caused his whole staff to draw
up around him, and when the bandage was removed from
the messenger's eyes, exclaimed to him: "What means
this insolence? Do you beard the French general in the
very centre of his army? Go and tell your general that I
give him eight minutes to lay down his arms; he is in
the midst of the French army, and if a single gun is fired,
I will cause every man to be shot." The officer, appalled
at discovering in whose presence he stood, returned to his
comrades with Napoleon's message.</p>

<p>The general of the enemy's column now made his
appearance, stating his willingness to surrender and capitulate.
"No" replied Bonaparte with energy, "you
are all prisoners of war." Seeing the Austrian officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
consulting together Napoleon instantly gave orders that
the artillery should advance and commence the attack.
On observing this the general of the enemy's forces exclaimed,
"We all surrender at discretion!" The shortness
of time allowed prevented the truth from being
discovered, and they gave in to a force about one-fourth
of their own. They believed that Lonato was occupied by
the French in numbers that made resistance impossible.
When the four thousand men had laid down their arms
they discovered that if they had used them nothing could
have prevented Napoleon from being taken as their prize!</p>

<p>Wurmser, whose fine army was thus being destroyed in
detail, now collected together the whole of his remaining
force, and advanced to meet the Conqueror. He had
determined on an assault and was hastening to the encounter.
They met between Lonato and Castiglione, and
Wurmser was totally defeated, besides narrowly escaping
being himself taken a prisoner. He was pursued into
Trent and Roveredo, the positions from which he had so
lately issued confident of victory. In this disastrous
campaign he had now lost forty thousand soldiers&mdash;half
his army&mdash;and all his artillery and stores, while Bonaparte
placed his own loss at seven thousand. The French
soldiers have called this succession of victories "the campaign
of five days." The rapid marches and incessant
fighting had exhausted the troops, and they now absolutely
required rest.</p>

<p>During the exciting days while the campaign with
Wurmser lasted, Napoleon never took off his clothes, nor
did he take the time to sleep except at brief intervals of
less than an hour. His exertions, which were followed
by such signal triumphs, were such as to demand some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
repose, yet he did not pause until he saw Mantua once
more completely invested. The reinforcement and revictualling
of the garrison were all that Wurmser could show
in requital of his lost artillery, stores and forty thousand
men.</p>

<p>While Napoleon was giving some respite to his wearied
army and rendering the subjugation of Italy complete,
Austria was hurrying a new army to the relief of its aged
but not disheartened marshal. The reinforcements of
twenty thousand fresh troops at last arrived, and Wurmser
was again in the field with fifty thousand men&mdash;an army
vastly larger than Napoleon's. But once more he divided
his forces and again each division was to be cut to pieces.
He marched thirty thousand men to the relief of Mantua,
and left Davidowich at Roveredo with twenty thousand
men to protect the passes of the Tyrol. The two Austrian
divisions were now separated and their fate was
sealed.</p>

<p>On September 4, by the most rapid marches Europe
had ever seen, Napoleon, having penetrated the designs
of the Austrian general, reached Roveredo where Davidowich
was intrenched in a strong position before the city,
covered by the guns of the Calliano castle overhanging
the town.</p>

<p>The camp was yielded on the same day before the terrific
charge of General Dubois and his hussars. The
latter, though mortally wounded, cheered his men on
with his dying words, and as he fell pressing the hand of
the general-in-chief, said: "Let me hear the shout of
victory for the Republic before I die." These words fired
his troops with deep ardor, and they drove the Austrians
through the town and carried the frowning heights of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
castle at the point of the bayonet, as they had carried the
batteries of Lodi. The French pursued the fleeing Austrians
throughout the night and Wurmser was cut off
from the Tyrol.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Austrian commander recovered from
his surprise at hearing of the overthrow of his lieutenant
at Roveredo before Napoleon, by a march of sixty miles
in two days, descended in front of his vanguard at Primolano
and cut it to pieces, taking four thousand prisoners.
The same night Napoleon's army advanced on
Bassano where on Sept. 8 Wurmser made his last stand
with the main body of his army.</p>

<p>While Augereau penetrated the town on his left,
Massena entered it on his right, seizing the cannon that
defended the bridge on the Bretna and overthrowing the
old grenadiers who attempted to cover the retreat of their
general. Five thousand prisoners, five standards, thirty-five
pieces of cannon with their caissons fell into the hands
of the French, and Wurmser himself narrowly escaped
being taken. Lannes seized one of the standards with
his own hands; and, in consequence, Bonaparte demanded
for him the rank of general of brigade. "He was," he
said, "the first who put the enemy to rout at Dego, who
passed the Po at Plaisance, the Adda at Lodi, and the first
to enter Bassano."</p>

<p>The number of the dead near the latter place was considerable.
Curious to ascertain the loss of the enemy,
Bonaparte in the evening rode over the field with his staff,
when his notice was attracted by the howlings of a dog
that seemed to increase as they approached the spot whence
the yells proceeded. "Amidst the deep silence of a beautiful
moon-light night," said Napoleon some years later,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
"a dog, leaping suddenly from beneath the clothes of his
dead master, rushed upon us, and then immediately
returned to his hiding-place, howling piteously. He
alternately licked his master's hand, and ran toward us,
as if at once soliciting aid and seeking revenge. Whether,
owing to my own particular turn of mind at the moment,
the time, the place, or the action itself, I know not, but,
certainly, no incident, on any field of battle, ever produced
so deep an impression on me. I involuntarily stopped to
contemplate the scene. This man, thought I, has friends
in the camp, or in his company, and here he lies forsaken
by all except his dog. What a lesson Nature presents
here, through the medium of an animal. What a strange
being is man! And how mysterious are his impressions!
I had, without emotion, ordered battles which
were to decide the fate of the army; I beheld, with
tearless eyes, the execution of those operations by which
numbers of my countrymen were sacrificed; and here my
feelings were roused by the howlings of a dog! Certainly,
at that moment, I should have been easily moved by a
suppliant enemy. I could very well imagine Achilles surrendering
up the body of Hector at the sight of Priam's
tears."</p>

<p>In these terrible marches Napoleon endured the same
privations as his men;&mdash;baggage and staff appointments
were unable to keep up with such rapid movements.
He shared his bread with one of his privates who
lived to remind him of this night when the Republican
general had become the Emperor of France.
It was during Napoleon's progress through Belgium
in 1804, while reviewing a division of the
army that he was visited in one of the towns by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
soldier of the fourth regiment of infantry who stepped
forward and thus addressed him: "General, in the year
Five of the French Revolution, being in the valley of Bassano,
I shared with you my ration of bread when you were
very hungry. You cannot have forgotten the circumstance.
I request, in return, that you provide bread for
my father who is worn with age and infirmity. I have
received five wounds in the service and was made corporal
and sergeant on the field of battle. I hope to be made a
lieutenant on the first vacancy." Napoleon recollected
the soldier and immediately acknowledged the reasonableness
of both his demands, which were speedily complied
with.</p>

<p>After the most heroic resistance Wurmser again fled.
Six thousand Austrians laid down their arms, and the
commander with his fleeing forces took refuge about the
middle of September in Mantua, whither they were pursued
by Napoleon's cavalry.</p>

<p>Wurmser was now strictly blockaded within the citadel
of Mantua with sixteen thousand men. These, with ten
thousand dispersed in the Tyrol, were all that remained
of his army of 60,000 men with which he was to reconquer
Italy. He had also lost seventy-five pieces of cannon,
thirty generals and twenty-two stands of colors. Marmont,
one of Napoleon's aids-de-camp, was sent with these
latter trophies to the Directory at Paris. Perceiving that
Wurmser now intended to avoid a general action Napoleon
returned to Milan, leaving General Kilmaine to conduct
the blockade.</p>

<p>While at Milan, Napoleon had just mounted his horse
one morning, when a dragoon, bearing important dispatches,
presented himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The commander gave a verbal answer, and ordered the
courier to take it back with all speed.</p>

<p>"I have no horse," the man answered; "I rode mine
so hard that it fell dead at your palace gates."</p>

<p>Napoleon alighted. "Take mine," he said.</p>

<p>The man hesitated.</p>

<p>"You think him too magnificently caparisoned and too
fine an animal;" said Napoleon. "Nothing is too good
for a French soldier!"</p>

<p>Again a call was made on Vienna to send a new army
and a greater general to restore the Hapsburg dominion in
Italy. In reply another powerful armament was dispatched
to the Italian frontier and this, the fourth campaign
against Napoleon, was intrusted to the supreme
command of Alvinzi, an officer of high reputation.</p>

<p>Field-Marshal Alvinzi was placed at the head of an
army of forty-five thousand men to which he joined eighteen
thousand under Davidowich in the Tyrol. His object
was to raise the blockade of Mantua, release Wurmser and,
with a force which would by the accession of the garrison
of the latter amount to an army of eighty thousand men
with which to oppose only thirty thousand. With these
he expected to reconquer Lombardy.</p>

<p>Three large armies, advancing with similar prospects,
had already been destroyed by Napoleon; a fourth now
prepared to pour down upon him, under still more terrible
circumstances. The battle of St. George and the strict
blockade of Wurmser in Mantua took place in the middle
of September. Alvinzi's army commenced its march in
the beginning of October.</p>

<p>Napoleon instantly ordered Vaubois and Massena to
advance to the attack of Davidowich, whose forces were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
collected in the Tyrol, before he could form a junction
with Alvinzi. Both failed. Vaubois, after two days'
fighting was conquered; lost Trent and Calliano, and was
forced to retreat. Massena in consequence had to effect a
retreat without attempting an engagement, and Alvinzi
approaching fast gained possession of all the country between
the Brenta and the Adige and the command of the
Tyrol. The two Austrian generals might now have
effected a junction, but they neglected their opportunity.
Napoleon hastened to Verona, Alvinzi having taken the
same route.</p>

<p>It seemed likely that Austria, in this new campaign,
was destined to recover her immense losses. Napoleon
was now contending against an enemy vastly superior in
numbers and most completely appointed. But twelve battalions
had been sent to him from France to recruit his
exhausted regiments, and nothing but the employment of
the highest military skill could now save him from
destruction.</p>

<p>"The army" said he, in writing to the Directory, "so
inferior in numbers, has been more weakened by the late
engagements, while the promised reinforcements have not
arrived. The heroes of Millessimo, Lodi, Castiglione, and
Bassano, are dead or in the hospitals. Joubert, Lanusse,
Victor, Lannes, Charlot, Murat, Dupuis, Rampon, Menard,
Chabrand, and Pigeon are wounded; we are abandoned
at the extremity of Italy. Had I received the 103d,
three thousand five hundred strong, I would have answered
for everything. Whereas, in a few days, 40,000 men, perhaps,
will not be sufficient to enable us to make head
against the enemy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>His men too, were becoming dispirited at the failure of
the government to send reinforcements, and no longer
fought with their accustomed vigor and enthusiasm. The
retreating forces came before him with dejected looks.
But the genius of Napoleon was not yet exhausted; with
him discouragement was not despair. He ordered Vaubois'
division&mdash;which had abandoned Calliano&mdash;drawn up on
the plain of Rivoli, and thus addressed them: "Soldiers,
I am not satisfied with you: you have shown neither
bravery, discipline, nor perseverance. No position could
rally you: you abandoned yourselves to a panic terror;
you suffered yourselves to be driven from
situations where a handful of brave men might have
stopped an army. Soldiers of the 29th and 85th, you are
not French soldiers. Quartermaster-general, let it be inscribed
on their colors: 'They no longer belong to the
Army of Italy!'"</p>

<p>The effect of these words was electric. The veteran
grenadiers who had braved the terrific charges at Lodi
sobbed like children and broke their ranks to cluster round
their commander to plead for one more trial. Several of
the veteran grenadiers, who had deserved and obtained
badges of distinction, called out from the ranks: "General!
we have been misrepresented; place us in the van of the
army and you shall then judge whether we do not belong
to the Army of Italy."</p>

<p>They were at last forgiven by their indignant commander,
and when they were again arrayed against the
enemy they quickly redeemed their lost reputation and
gained new laurels. But a spirit of discontent pervaded the
French army. "We cannot work miracles," said the soldiers.
"We destroyed Beaulieu's great army, and then came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Wurmser with a greater. We conquered and broke him
to pieces, and then came Alvinzi more powerful than ever.
When we have conquered him Austria will pour down on
us a hundred thousand fresh soldiers and we shall leave
our bones in Italy."</p>

<p>Although much dispirited, Napoleon was by no
means disposed to abandon his campaign; to his soldiers
he said by way of encouragement: "We have but one
more effort to make and Italy is ours. The enemy is no
doubt superior to us in numbers, but not in valor. When
he is beaten Mantua must fall, and we shall be masters of
all; our labors will be at an end, for not only Italy but a
general peace is in Mantua. You talk of returning to the
Alps, but you are no longer capable of doing so. From
the dry and frozen bivouacs of those sterile rocks you
could very well conquer the delicious plains of Lombardy;
but from the smiling flowery bivouacs of Italy you cannot
return to Alpine snows. Only beat Alvinzi and I will
answer for your future welfare."</p>

<p>Ere long the French forces were once more ready for
battle. Alvinzi had occupied the heights of Caldiero and
by the middle of November threatened Verona. Massena
attacked the heights but found them impregnable. The
French were repulsed with considerable loss. Napoleon
found it necessary to attempt taking the heights by other
means in order to prevent the junction of Davidowich and
Alvinzi. Pretending, therefore, to retreat on Mantua after
his discomfiture, he returned in the night and placed himself
in the rear of Alvinzi's army. When his columns
advanced on Arcola the enemy thought at first it was only
a skirmish and that the main army of the French was in
Verona. The position of Arcola rendered any attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
upon it so extremely hazardous that scarcely anyone
would have conceived the idea of making the attempt.
The village is surrounded by marshes intersected by small
streams, by ditches and by three causeways or bridges,
across which alone the marshes are passable. Arcola and
the bridge leading to it were defended by two battalions
of Alvinzi's army, and two pieces of cannon which commanded
the bridge. The other two causeways were unprotected.</p>

<p>Napoleon ordered a division to charge the bridge of
Arcola at daybreak. The attempt seemed even to the
intrepid Augereau to be courting death, but he was a true
soldier and obeyed orders.</p>

<p>On November 15 a column advanced on each of the
three causeways. Augereau's division occupied the
bridge of Arcola which was swept by the enemy's cannon
and assailed in flank by their battalions. Even the chosen
grenadiers, led by Augereau with a standard in his hand,
faltered and fell back under the destructive fire, fleeing
over the corpses of nearly half their comrades. It was
a most critical situation, and one in which a false step or
the loss of a few moments meant ruin. Napoleon, who
knew that the moment was decisive, dashed at the head
of the column, snatched a standard, and hurrying onwards
planted the colors with his own hands on the bridge amidst
a hail of balls from the enemy's artillery and musketry.
As he did so he cried out: "Soldiers! are you no longer
the brave warriors of Lodi? Follow your general!"</p>

<p>His soldiers rallied and rushed with him till they
grappled with the Austrian division, but the sudden
arrival of a fresh column of the enemy made it an impossibility
to maintain their ground. The French fell back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and Napoleon, being in the very midst of the fight, was
himself seized by his faithful grenadiers who bore him
away in their arms through smoke, the dead and dying, as
they were driven backwards inch by inch with dreadful
carnage. Mounting a horse the commander once more
prepared to make a charge at the head of his heroic troops,
when his steed became unmanageable and plunged headlong
throwing its rider into a morass up to his waist.</p>

<p>The Austrians were now between Napoleon and his
baffled column. As the smoke rolled away the army at
once perceived the critical position of their general.
During this crisis Lannes pressed forward through the
marsh and reached his commander as also did the gallant
Muiron, the friend and aide-de-camp of Napoleon.
Almost at the same moment a shot was fired at Napoleon.
It was received by Muiron, who had interposed himself,
and he died covering Napoleon's body with his own.
But still the person of the commander remained in the
utmost peril.</p>

<p>The grenadiers now formed in an instant, and with the
cry, "Forward, soldiers, to save your general!" threw
themselves upon the enemy, rescued their "Little Corporal"
from his critical position and overthrew the
Austrian columns that defended the bridge. Napoleon
was quickly at their head again, rallied the column, struck
terror through the ranks of the enemy, and Arcola was soon
taken. Two other engagements followed at this point, in
each of which the French were victorious, Massena pursuing
the enemy until darkness compelled him to desist. The
Austrians lost twelve thousand men killed, six thousand
prisoners, eighteen pieces of cannon and four stands of
colors. The loss of the French was less considerable in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
numbers than in the importance of the prominent individuals
who fell during those three days, when the
generals acted as soldiers, continually fighting at the
heads of their columns. The great art of Napoleon, on
that occasion, he having but 13,000 to oppose 40,000 men,
was to maintain the combat in the midst of a morass where
the enemy could not deploy. Upon such a field of battle,
only the heads of the columns could engage; whereas, on
a plain, the French army would in all probability have
been surrounded.</p>

<p>Napoleon said at St. Helena that he considered himself
in the greatest danger at Arcola.</p>

<p>When too late Davidowich made an advance upon Verona,
but retreated quickly on hearing of Alvinzi's defeat at
Arcola. Wurmser, too, made a desperate sally and was
repulsed. He still held out, however. The horses of the
garrison had long since been killed and salted for use;
the men were reduced to half rations, and their numbers
were being rapidly reduced by disease.</p>

<p>This fourth attempt of Austria to conquer Napoleon
ended, therefore, as did the previous ones, in failure. It
was one of the most memorable campaigns in history, in
the course of which all the resources of skilled warriors
were exhibited, not in a contest of a few hours but a succession
of memorable battles. As yet, however, the
young commander was but a temporary victor; the weakness
of the Army of Italy did not permit him to draw all
the advantages he had promised himself from Arcola.
Alvinzi was now thoroughly beaten, his losses were very
great, and like his predecessors he sent to Vienna for reinforcements
to continue his contest against Bonaparte, who
had repaired to Verona which he fixed upon as the central
point of operations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Once more the Austrian general's preparations were
completed for a fresh campaign, and on January 7, 1797,
at the head of sixty thousand soldiers, consisting of volunteers
from the best families in Vienna and battalions from
the Army of the Rhine, Croats, Hungarians, Tyroleans,
etc., Alvinzi descended from the northern barriers of Italy
to release the brave Wurmser from his prison at
Mantua, and again attempt to "overwhelm the French
invaders." A messenger dispatched to Wurmser from the
imperial court was captured by the French, and dispatches
concealed in wax balls recovered. From these
Napoleon learned the present designs, signed by the
emperor's own hand, of the Austrian government:&mdash;Alvinzi
was once more placed at the head of sixty thousand
men, and was again to march into Lombardy and to
raise the siege of Mantua: Wurmser was directed to hold
out to the last extremity: If the army of Alvinzi could be
reunited with the garrison, the destruction of the French
seemed undoubted; if not, and if, in the course of hostilities,
he found it best to abandon Mantua, he was directed
to cut his way into Romagna and to take command of the
papal troops, the pope having broken the treaty of Bologna,
and raised an army of seven thousand men to act in concert
with Wurmser, when he should be released from
Mantua.</p>

<p>Again the Austrian army,&mdash;the fifth&mdash;was divided, one
column under Alvinzi for the line of the Adige; the other
for the Bretna under General Provera, who was to join the
marshal under the walls of Mantua.</p>

<p>When Napoleon learned this at his headquarters at
Verona he posted Joubert at Rivoli to dispute Alvinzi's
passage, and Augereau to watch the movements of Provera,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
knowing that within a few hours he could concentrate
his own forces on either column.</p>

<p>At sunset on the 13th of January Joubert's messenger
brought the news that he had met Alvinzi and with
difficulty held him in check through the day. Napoleon
examined with the utmost attention the maps and descriptions
of the places, the reports of the generals, and those
of his spies and light troops and passed a part of the night
in a state of uncertainty and indecision. At length on
receiving fresh reports he exclaimed: "It is clear&mdash;it is
clear: to Rivoli!" and, quickly giving his orders to his
aides assigning the troops to their different routes, he left
a garrison at Verona and with General Massena and all
the disposable troops he repaired to General Joubert. By
one of his lightning marches he reached the heights of
Rivoli two hours after midnight. Below in the valley five
separate encampments of the Austrian army were visible
in the moonlight. Napoleon quickly decided to force
Alvinzi to battle before he was ready. Joubert, confounded
by the display of Alvinzi's gigantic force was in the very
act of abandoning his position when the French commander
checked his movement, and, bringing up more
battalions, forced the enemy from a position they had
seized on the first symptoms of the French retreat.</p>

<p>From the eminence on which he stood Napoleon's keen
eye soon penetrated the secret of Alvinzi's weakness,&mdash;that
his artillery had not yet arrived. To force him to accept
battle, Napoleon took every possible means to conceal his
own arrival and prolonged, by a series of petty manoeuvres,
the enemy's belief that they had to do with a mere
outpost of the French. Alvinzi was fully deceived, and
instead of advancing on some great and well-arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
system, suffered his several columns to endeavor to
force the heights by insulated movements which the real
strength of Napoleon easily enabled him to baffle. Two
field-pieces had been abandoned by their drivers and which
were seized by the enemy, when an officer whose name is
not recorded, advancing, cried out: "Fourteenth, will
you let them take your artillery?" Berthier, who had
purposely suffered the enemy to approach, then opened a
terrible fire, which leveled men and horses round the
guns, and upon which the Austrians immediately fell back.</p>

</div>

<p>A moment later the bravery of the enemy resulted in
their nearly overthrowing the French on a point of pre-eminent
importance, but Napoleon himself, galloping to
the spot, roused by his voice and action the division of
Massena who, having marched all night, had laid down
to rest in the extreme of weariness. They started up at
the commander's voice and the Austrian column was
speedily repulsed.</p>

<p>The French artillery was soon in position, while that of
the Austrians, as Napoleon had guessed, had not yet come
up, and this circumstance decided the fortune of the day.
The batteries of the French made havoc of the broken
columns; the cavalry made repeated charges; four out of
the five divisions were thus broken and utterly routed.
The fifth now made its appearance in the rear of the
French. It had been sent round to outflank Napoleon
and take higher ground in his rear according to the orders
of the Austrian general before the action. When Lusignan's
division achieved its destined object it did so,&mdash;not
to complete the misery of a routed, but to swell the prey
of a victorious, enemy. Instead of cutting off the retreat
of Joubert, Lusignan found himself insulated from Alvinzi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and forced to lay down his arms to Bonaparte. Had this
movement been made a little sooner it might have turned
the fortune of the day: as it was, the French soldiers
only exclaimed: "Here come further supplies to our
market!" and very soon the Austrians, exposed to a
heavy fire from the artillery, were forced to surrender.</p>

<p>"Here was a good plan," said Napoleon, "but these
Austrians are not apt to calculate the value of minutes."</p>

<p>Had Lusignan gained the rear of the French an hour
earlier, while the contest was still hot in front of the
heights of Rivoli, he might have aided in the complete
overthrow of Napoleon instead of being defeated on one
of the brightest days in the young commander's career.</p>

<p>In the course of the day Bonaparte had remained in the
hottest of the fight, which lasted during twelve hours, and
had three horses shot under him, and although much
fatigued, hardly waited to see Lusignan surrender ere he set
off with reinforcements to the Lower Adige to prevent
Wurmser from either housing Provera or joining him in
the open field and so effect the escape of his own formidable
garrison. The flying troops of Alvinzi were left to
the care of Massena, Murat and Joubert.</p>

<p>Marching all day and the next night Napoleon reached
the vicinity of Mantua late on the 15th. He found the
enemy strongly posted and Serrurier's position highly
critical. A regiment of Provera's hussars had but a few
hours before established themselves in the suburb of St.
George. This Austrian corps had been clothed in white
cloaks resembling those of a well-known French regiment
of hussars, and advancing towards the gate would certainly
have been admitted as friends but for the sagacity
of an old sergeant, who could not help fancying that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
white cloaks had too much of the gloss of novelty about
them to have stood the wear and tear of three Bonapartean
campaigns. He instantly closed the barriers and warned
a drummer who was near him of the danger. These two
gave the alarm and the guns of the blockading force were
instantly turned upon their pretended friends who were
forced to retire.</p>

<p>Napoleon himself passed the night in walking the outposts,
so great was his anxiety. At one of these he found
a grenadier sentinel asleep from exhaustion and taking
his gun, without waking him, performed a sentinel's duty
in his place for about half an hour. When the man,
starting from his slumbers, perceived with terror and despair
the countenance and occupation of his general, he fell
on his knees before him. "My friend," said Napoleon
mildly, "here is your musket. You had fought hard and
marched long and your exhaustion is excusable; but a
moment's inattention might at present ruin the whole
army. I happened to be awake and have held your post
for you. You will be more careful another time!"</p>

<p>Such acts of magnanimity endeared Napoleon to his
soldiers, and, while he rarely relaxed in his military discipline,
he early acquired the devotion of his men who
told and retold anecdotes of his doings in camp and on
the battlefield, and as the stories spread from column to
column his followers came to regard him with a veneration
that few older commanders have been able to instill in
their men. Another anecdote is related of Bonaparte,
when upon the point of commencing one of his great
battles in Italy. As he was disposing his troops in
order of attack, a light dragoon stepping from the ranks,
requested of the commander a few minutes private conver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>sation
to which Napoleon acquiesced, when the soldier
thus addressed him: "General, if you will proceed to
adopt such and such measures, the enemy must be
defeated."</p>

<p>"Wretched man," exclaimed the commander, "hold
your tongue; you will surely not betray my secret" at the
same time placing his hand before the mouth of the
dragoon.</p>

<p>The soldier in question was possessed of an inherent
military capacity and appreciated every arrangement necessary
to insure victory. The battle terminating in favor
of Napoleon, he issued orders that the poor fellow should
be conducted to his presence; but all search for him
proved fruitless, he was nowhere to be found: a bullet
had no doubt terminated his military career.</p>

<p>The next morning there ensued a hot skirmish, recorded
as the battle of St. George. The tumult and slaughter
were dreadful and Provera with his whole force were compelled
to lay down their arms. Wurmser, who had
hazarded a sortie from Mantua to join his countrymen,
was glad to make his way back again, and retire within
the old walls, in consequence of a desperate assault headed
by Napoleon in person, who threw himself between
Wurmser and Provera and beat them completely one
after the other. Provera now found himself cut off hopelessly
from Alvinzi and surrounded by the French; he
was disheartened and defeated. He and his five thousand
men laid down their arms on the 16th of January,
and various bodies of the Austrian force scattered over
the country followed their example. This latter engagement
was called the battle of La Favorita from the name
of a country house near which it was fought. The 75th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
at this battle refused cartridges: "With such enemies as
we have before us," said they, "we must only use the
bayonet."</p>

<p>The battles of Rivoli and La Favorita had disabled
Alvinzi from continuing the campaign. Thus had the
magnificent army of Austria ceased to exist in three days.</p>

<p>Such was the prevailing terror of the enemy at this time
that in one instance René, a young officer keeping guard
of a position with about one hundred and fifty men, suddenly
encountered and took prisoners a small body of Austrians.
On advancing to reconnoitre, he found himself in
front of a body of eighteen hundred more, whom a turn in
the road had concealed from his sight. "Lay down your
arms!" said the Austrian commandant. René answered
with boldness, "Do you lay down your arms! I have
destroyed your advance guard;&mdash;ground your arms, or
no quarter!" The French soldiers joined in the cry, and
the whole body of the astonished Austrians absolutely
laid down their arms to a party, which they found to their
exasperation when too late, was in numbers one twelfth
of their own.</p>

<p>Wurmser was now thoroughly disheartened in not
receiving relief, and as his provisions were by this
time exhausted, found himself at length in dire
straits. Napoleon sent him word of the rout and
dispersion of the Austrian army and summoned him to
surrender. The old soldier proudly replied that "he had
provisions for a year," but a few days later he sent his
aide-de-camp, Klenau to the headquarters of Serrurier
with an offer of capitulation. General Serrurier, as commander
of the blockade, received the bearer of Wurmser's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
message in which he stated that he was "still in a condition
to hold out considerably longer, unless honorable terms
were granted."</p>

<p>Napoleon, who had been seated in a corner of his tent
wrapped in his cloak, now came forward and addressed
himself to the Austrian envoy, who had no suspicion in
whose presence he had been speaking, and taking his pen,
wrote down marginal answers to the conditions proposed
by Wurmser. He granted terms more favorable than
might have been exacted in the extremity to which
the veteran was reduced. "These," said he, "are the conditions
to which your general's bravery entitles him if he
opens his gates tomorrow. He may have them to-day;
a week, a month hence, he shall have no worse: he may
hold out to his last morsel of bread. Meantime tell him
that General Bonaparte is about to set out for Rome."</p>

<p>The envoy now recognized Napoleon, and on reading
the paper perceived that the proposed terms were more
liberal than he had dared to hope for; he then owned that
only three days' provisions remained in Mantua.</p>

<p>The capitulation was forthwith signed and on the 2d of
February, 1797, Wurmser and his garrison of 13,000 men
marched out of Mantua: 7,000 were lying in the hospitals.
When the aged chief was by the fortunes of war to
surrender his sword, he found only Serrurier ready to
receive it. Napoleon was unwilling to be a witness to
the humiliation of the distinguished veteran, and had
left the place before the surrender, thus sparing the conquered
veteran the mortification of giving up his sword
to so youthful a commander. This delicate generosity
on the part of the French general was never forgotten by
Wurmser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The terms of surrender agreed to by Bonaparte were
not readily accepted by the French Directory, who
urged him to far different conduct. "I have granted
the Austrian," he wrote in reply, "such terms as were, in
my judgment, due to a brave and honorable foe, and to
the dignity of the French nation." The loss of the Austrians
at Mantua amounted altogether to not less than
30,000 men, besides innumerable military stores and upwards
of 500 brass cannon.</p>

<p>The conquerer sent Augereau to Paris with the sixty
captured standards of Austria, and his arrival at the capital
was celebrated as a national festival. Thus it was
that Napoleon, with a total force at the utmost, of 65,000
men, conquered, in their own country, and under the eye
and succoring hand of their own government, five successive
armies, amounting, in all, to <i>upwards of 300,000
well-appointed well-provisioned soldiers</i>, under old and
experienced commanders of approved courage. Such was
the conquest of Lombardy.</p>

<p>Some time later Wurmser sent Napoleon a letter by
special messenger acknowledging the generosity and delicacy
of conduct of the French commander at Mantua, and
at the same time apprising him by his aide-de-camp of a
conspiracy to poison him in the dominions of the pope,
with whom he was about to wage war.</p>

<p>A few brief engagements with papal troops followed the
capitulation of Wurmser, the pope fearing that the conqueror
would enter the "Eternal City;" but Napoleon,
by a rapid movement, threw his infantry across the river
Senio, where the enemy was encamped, and met with but a
brief resistance. Shortly afterwards the pope entered into
negotiations with the French commander, and the treaty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of Tolentino followed on the 13th of February, 1797, conceding
to the French one hundred of the finest works of
art, several castles and legations, and about two millions
of dollars.</p>

<p>Napoleon was now master of all Northern Italy with
the exception of the territories of Venice, which announced
that it had no desire but to preserve a perfect neutrality.</p>

<p>More than a month had now elapsed since Alvinzi's
defeat at Rivoli; in nine days the war with the pope had
reached its close; and, having left some garrisons in the
town on the Adige to watch the neutrality of Venice,
Napoleon hastened to carry the war into the hereditary
dominions of the Austrian Emperor. Twenty thousand
fresh troops had joined his victorious standard from
France, and at the head of perhaps a larger force than he
had ever before mustered, he proceeded towards the Tyrol
where, according to his information, the main army of
Austria, recruited once more to its original strength, was
preparing to open a sixth campaign under the orders,&mdash;not
of Alvinzi, but of a general young like himself, and
hitherto eminently successful, the Archduke Charles, who
had defeated the courage and skill of Jourdan and Moreau
on the Rhine, and was now to be opposed to Napoleon.</p>

<p>The story of this sixth campaign is but a repetition of
the five that preceded it. The archduke, a young prince
of high talents, and upon whom the last hopes of the Austrian
Empire reposed, compelled by the council of Vienna
to execute a plan he had the discrimination to condemn,
was destined to lead but a short campaign, although he had
the best army Austria could enroll. This army once more
proceeded to begin operations on a double basis, and
Napoleon permitted him to assume the offensive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 9th of March, 1797, the French commander's headquarters
were fixed at Bassano, and he proceeded vigorously
on his career of conquest. He issued one of his stirring
proclamations, in which he told his soldiers that a grand
destiny was still reserved for them, and then advanced
to attack the archduke. He found the latter posted upon
the plains bordering on the banks of the river Tagliamento
in front of the rugged Carinthian mountains which guard
the passage in that quarter from Italy to Germany.
Detaching Massena with a division of cavalry to effect the
passage of the Piave where the Austrian division of
Lusignan was posted, Napoleon determined to charge the
archduke in front. Massena was successful in driving
Lusignan before him as far as Belluno, where he, with a
rear guard of 500, surrendered, and thus turned the Austrian
flank.</p>

<p>On the 16th of March, the two armies headed by Napoleon,
and the Archduke Charles in person, were drawn
up on opposite sides of the Tagliamento, face to face.
Bonaparte then attempted to effect the passage of the river,
but after a formal display of his forces, which was met by
similar demonstrations on the Austrian side of the river,
he suddenly broke up his line, retreated, and took up his
bivouac. The archduke concluded that, as the French
had been marching all the night before, their leader
wished to defer the battle until another day, and in like
manner withdrew to his encampment. About two hours
later Napoleon rushed with his whole army, who had
merely laid down in ranks, upon the margin of the Tagliamento,&mdash;no
longer adequately guarded,&mdash;and had
forded the stream ere the Austrian line of battle could be
formed. In the passage of the Tagliamento Napoleon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
was so nearly drowned, by the submersion of his carriage,
that he for some moments gave up all thoughts of being
rescued.</p>

<p>This affair was the first in which the division of Bernadotte
had borne a part. He arrived upon the borders of
the Tagliamento at the very moment of the combat:
throwing himself into the river he exclaimed to his followers,
"Think that you are the Army of the Rhine, and
that the Army of Italy is looking on you!"</p>

<p>In the action which followed the troops of the archduke
displayed much gallantry, and charged the French repeatedly
with the greatest courage, but every effort to dislodge
Napoleon failed; at length retreat was deemed
necessary, and eight pieces of cannon and some provisions
were left behind, the French following in close pursuit.</p>

<p>Adjutant General Kellerman distinguished himself at
the head of the French cavalry and received many
wounds in executing the manoeuvres that decided the success
of the day; he was subsequently charged with carrying
the trophies taken from the enemy to France.</p>

<p>The pursuers stormed Gradisca, where they made 6,000
prisoners; and the archduke continuing his retreat,
occupied in the course of a few days Trieste, Fiume and
every stronghold in Carinthia. In the course of a campaign
of twenty days the Austrians fought Bonaparte
ten times; but the overthrow on the Tagliamento was
never recovered. Their army was melting away like the
snows of the Tyrol.</p>

<p>At last the Austrian leader decided to reach Vienna by
forced marches, there to gather round him whatever force
the loyalty of his nation could muster, and make a last
stand beneath the walls of the capital. The archduke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
expected to reap great advantage from enticing the
French army into the heart of Austria, where, divided by
many wide provinces and mighty mountains and rivers
from France, and with Italy once more in arms behind
them, he hoped to cut off their source of supplies and
compel them to retreat from a greatly reinforced imperial
army.</p>

<p>From the period of the opening of the campaign the
archduke had lost nearly 20,000 men made prisoners, so
that the Austrians could make no stand except upon the
mountains in the neighborhood of the Capital.</p>

<p>Vienna, however, was terror-stricken on hearing that
Napoleon who was only sixty leagues distant, had stormed
the passes of the Julian Alps. The imperial family&mdash;embracing
little Marie Louise, then scarcely six years
old, afterwards Napoleon's wife&mdash;fled with their crown
jewels and treasures into Hungary; the middle classes
became clamorous for a termination of the six years' war,
and the archduke was ordered to avail himself of the first
pretense which circumstances might afford for the opening
of a negotiation. Napoleon wrote to the archduke
suggesting peace: "While brave soldiers carry on war
they wish for peace;" he said, "Has not the war
already lasted six years? Have we not killed men
enough, and inflicted sufficient sufferings on the human
race? Europe has laid down the arms she took up against
the French Republic. Your nation alone perseveres; yet
blood is to flow more copiously than ever. Whatever be
the issue, we shall kill some thousands of men on both
sides, and after all we must come to an understanding,
since all things have an end, not excepting vindictive
passions. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* For my part, general, if the over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>ture
I have the honor to make to you should only save
the life of a single man, I should feel more proud of the
civic crown, I should think I thereby merited, than
of all the melancholy glory that the most distinguished
military successes can afford."</p>

<p>The archduke replied within two hours after the receipt
of the letter and a series of negotiations followed, which
with Napoleon's rapid advance on Vienna, finally brought
about the provisional treaty of Leoben, signed April 18,
1797. Napoleon, without waiting for full power from the
Directory to complete the treaty, took the responsibility
upon himself and signed it on the part of France on the
19th of April. The Austrian plenipotentiaries had set
down as a primary concession that "the Emperor acknowledged
the French Republic."</p>

<p>"Strike that out!" said Napoleon; "the Republic is
like the sun that shines by its own light; none but the
blind can fail to see it. We are our own masters and
shall establish any government we prefer." "If the
French people should one day wish to create a monarchy,"
he afterwards remarked, "the Emperor might object that
he had recognized a Republic."</p>

<p>This treaty was followed by a complete surrender
on the part of the Venetian Senate which had violated its
pledges of neutrality, and a democratic government was
formed, provisionally, on the model of France. Venice
consented to surrender to the victor large territories on
the mainland of Italy; five ships of war, $600,000 in gold
and as much more in naval stores, twenty of her best
works of art and 500 ancient manuscripts. Napoleon
took possession of the city, and the history of the Venetian
Republic was ended. In their last agony the Venetian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Senate made a vain attempt to bribe Napoleon with a
purse of seven millions of francs for more favorable terms,
reminding him of the proverbial ingratitude of all popular
governments and of the slight attention which the French
Directory had hitherto paid to his personal interests.
"That is all true enough," he replied, "but I will not
place myself in the power of this duke." To a larger
tender on the part of Austria he replied: "If greatness or
richness is to be mine, it must come from France."</p>

<p>Among the works of art sent by Napoleon to Paris was
the celebrated picture of St. Jerome from the Duke of
Parma's gallery. The duke, to save this treasure, offered
Napoleon two hundred thousand dollars, which the conqueror
refused to take, saying: "The sum which he offers
us will soon be spent; but the possession of such a masterpiece
at Paris will adorn that capital for ages, and give
birth to similar exertions of genius."</p>

<p>The fall of Venice gave Napoleon the means of bringing
his treaty with Austria to a more satisfactory conclusion
than had been indicated in the preliminaries of Leoben.
After settling the affairs of Venice and establishing the
new Ligurian Republic he took up his residence at the
palace of Montibello, near Milan, with Josephine, whom
he had not seen since his departure from France a year
before. The final settlement with Austria's commissioners
was purposely delayed by that Empire, it being the universal
belief that the government of France was approaching a
new crisis, and Austria hoped from such an event to derive
considerable advantage. Napoleon was becoming weary
of the protracted negotiations and threats of the Austrian
ambassadors. One day in the latter's chamber, he suddenly
changed his demeanor. "You refuse to accept our ulti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>matum,"
said he, taking in his hands a beautiful vase of
porcelain, which stood on the mantelpiece near him. The
Austrian bowed. "It is well," said Napoleon, "the
truce is broken, war is declared, but mark me,&mdash;within
three months I shall shatter Austria as I now shatter this
brittle affair!" So saying he dashed the fragile piece
furiously to the floor, breaking it into a thousand pieces,
and left the room. The ambassador followed him, and
finding him preparing to march on Vienna, made submissions
which induced him to once more resume negotiations,
the result of which was the treaty of Campo-Formio,
so called from the humble village at which it was signed
on the 17th of October, 1797.</p>

<p>Bourrienne relates that while Napoleon was occupied
with the organization of Venice, Genoa and Milan, he
used to complain of the want of <i>men</i>. "Good God!"
said he, "how rare <i>men</i> are! There are eighteen millions
in Italy and I have with difficulty found two real ones,&mdash;Dandolo
and Lelzi." These two actual "men" were
immediately employed in important services, and justified
his estimation of them.</p>

<p>It was from the palace of Montibello, five leagues from
Milan, that Napoleon wrote to the Directory: "From these
different points (the islands of the Mediterranean, which
he proposed to seize) we can command that sea, keep an
eye on the Ottoman Empire, which is crumbling to
pieces, and we can render the supremacy of the ocean
almost useless to Great Britain. <i>Let us take possession of
Egypt</i>, which lies on the road to India, and there we can
found one of the mightiest colonies in the world. It is
in Egypt we must make war on England."</p>

<p>To perfect the treaty with Austria Napoleon received
orders from the French Directory to appear at a congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
at Rastadt, all the German powers being summoned to meet
there for that purpose. He took an affecting leave of his
soldiers, in which he said in closing: "Soldiers, when you
talk of the princes you have conquered, of the nations you
have set free, and the battles you have fought in two
campaigns, say: 'In the next two we shall do still more.'"
He then proceeded by way of Switzerland, carrying with
him the unbounded love and devotion of one of the finest
armies that the world had ever seen.</p>

<p>A person who saw Napoleon at this time described his
impressions of him in the following letter, which appeared
in one of the Paris journals in December 1797: "With
lively interest and extreme attention, I have observed this
extraordinary man, who has performed such great deeds,
and about whom there is something which seems to indicate
that his career is not yet closed. I found him very like
his portraits&mdash;little, thin, pale, with an air of fatigue,
but not of ill-health, as has been reported of him. He
appears to me to listen with more abstraction than interest,
and that he was more occupied with what he was
thinking of than with what was said to him. There is a
great intelligence in his countenance, along with which
may be marked an air of habitual meditation which
reveals nothing of what is passing within. In that thinking
head, in that bold mind, it is impossible not to believe
that some daring designs are engendering <i>which will have
their influence on the destinies of Europe</i>!"</p>

<p>"My extreme youth when I took command of the Army of
Italy," Napoleon remarked afterwards, "made it necessary
for me to evince great reserve of manners and the utmost
severity of morals. This was indispensable to enable me to
sustain authority over men so greatly superior in age and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
experience. I pursued a line of conduct in the highest
degree irreproachable and exemplary. In spotless morality
I was a Cato and must have appeared such to all.
My supremacy could be retained only by proving myself
a better man than any other man in the army. Had I
yielded to human weakness I should have lost my power."</p>

<p>At the first interview between Napoleon and the veteran
generals whom he was to command, Rampon undertook
to give the young commander some advice. Napoleon
who was impatient of advice, exclaimed: "Gentlemen,
the art of war is in its infancy. The time has passed in
which enemies are mutually to appoint the place of combat,
advance hat in hand and say: '<i>Gentlemen will you
have the goodness to fire</i>!' We must cut the enemy to
pieces, precipitate ourselves like a torrent upon their battalions
and grind them to powder. Experienced generals
conduct the troops opposed to us. So much the better!
Their experience will not avail them against me. Mark
my words, they will soon burn their books on tactics and
know not what to do."</p>

<p>Arriving at Rastadt Napoleon found that the multiplicity
of details to be arranged was likely to require a long
stay, and as his personal relations with the Directory were
of a doubtful kind, he abandoned the conduct of the diplomatic
business to his colleagues and reached Paris after a
triumphal march, on the 20th of November, 1797. During
his absence he had been the salvation of France, and
his arrival created a great sensation in the capital. He
was hailed with the most rapturous applause by the people,
the streets through which he was expected to pass were
thronged, and wherever he was seen the air was filled with
shouts of, "Long live the General of the Army of Italy!"</p>

EXPEDITION TO EGYPT</h2>

<p class="p2">On the 2nd of October, 1797, during Napoleon's absence
in Italy, the Directory announced to the French people its
intention of carrying the war with England into England
itself. The immediate organization of a great invading
army was therefore ordered, and "Citizen General Bonaparte,"
the Conqueror of Italy, was designated to command
the forces.</p>

<p>It was some months before this decision was acted upon,
however, and in the meantime Napoleon lived quietly in
a small, modest house in the Rue Chantereine, which he
had occupied before he set out for Italy. Shortly after
his return, on going home one evening, he was surprised
to find workmen engaged in changing the sign bearing
the name of the street to "Rue de la Victoire," in commemoration
of his Italian campaign. He seemed to
avoid as much as possible at this time the honors of popular
distinction and applause that the people heaped upon
him. One morning he sent his secretary to a theatre
manager to ask him to give that evening two very popular
pieces, "if such a thing were possible."</p>

<p>"Nothing is impossible for General Bonaparte," replied
the courtly manager; "the Conqueror of Italy has long
ago erased that word from the dictionary!"</p>

<p>This flattering answer afforded Napoleon a hearty laugh.
He went to the performance and although endeavoring to
maintain his usual privacy, was discovered and loudly
called upon to come forward. The honor which he
esteemed most was his nomination as a member of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Institute. He frequently attended its meetings and was
also fond of appearing in the costume worn by the members.</p>

<p>When congratulated by Bourrienne on some noisy demonstration
of popular favor, he answered in the words of
Cromwell; "Bah! they would crowd as eagerly about
me if I were on my way to the scaffold!"</p>

<p>Wherever he went he was still the Bonaparte of Lodi,
Arcola and Rivoli.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the government gave him no adequate
reward for his important services in Italy. He had not
when he returned to France, three hundred thousand
francs in his possession, though he had transmitted fifty
millions to the State. "I might easily," he said to Las
Casas, "have brought back ten or twelve millions; I
never made out any accounts, nor was I ever asked for
any." On the eve of his departure for Egypt he became
possessed of Malmaison and there deposited nearly all
his property. He purchased it in the name of his wife,
older than himself, and consequently, in case of his surviving
her, he must have forfeited all right to the same.
The fact, as stated by himself, was, that he never had a
taste or desire for the acquirement of riches.</p>

<p>He willingly accepted the new appointment now pressed
upon him by the government, who seemed anxious that
he should not remain in Paris to take part in the civil
business of the State. In this latter direction he had no
desire for continued service. In Napoleon's own language,
"the pear was not yet ripe," and, like Cæsar, he
would have preferred being first in a village to being
second in Rome. The first scheme of the French Directory
was to make a descent upon England and to place Napoleon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
at the head of the invading army, but their counsels continually
fluctuated between this project and the Egyptian
expedition. Napoleon said to Bourrienne on the 29th of
January: "Bourrienne, I shall remain here no longer;
they (the Directory) do not want me; there is no good to
be done; they will not listen to me. I see, if I loiter here,
I am done for quickly. Here everything grows flat; my
glory is already on the wane. This little Europe of yours
cannot supply the demand. We must move to the East.
All great reputations come from that quarter. But I will
first take a turn round the coast to assure myself what can
be done. If the success of a descent upon England appears
doubtful, as I fear, the army of England shall become
the army of the East, and I am off for Egypt." He at
length resolved to bring the question of the invasion to a
decision by a personal survey of the coast opposite England.
While there he busied himself for a time in suggesting
improvements in fortifications and in selecting the
best points for embarking an invading force. Many local
improvements of great importance, long afterwards
effected, were first suggested by him at this period; but
the time had not come for invading England.</p>

<p>Napoleon had suggested to Talleyrand, minister of foreign
affairs, some months before, the propriety of making
an effort against England in another quarter of the globe;
i. e., of seizing Malta, proceeding to Egypt, and therein
gaining at once a territory capable of supplying to France
the loss of her West Indian colonies, and the means of
annoying Great Britain in her Indian trade and empire.</p>

<p>The East presented to him a field of conquest and glory,
and to this he now again recurred. "Europe is but a
mole hill," he said; "All the great glories have come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
from Asia where there are six hundred millions of men."
He soon returned to Paris and made his views known
to the Directory, declaring that an invasion of England
was a wild chimera. To Bourrienne, his school companion,
who asked him concerning his contemplated invasion
after he had been on the coast a week he said: "The
risk is too great; I sha'n't venture it. I don't want to
trifle with the fate of France."</p>

<p>The temptation of the Directory was great, and as it
would find employment for Napoleon at a distance from
France, the Egyptian expedition was finally determined
upon; but kept a great secret.</p>

<p>While the attention of Great Britain was now riveted
on the coast, it was on the borders of the Mediterranean
that his ships and the troops really destined for action,
were assembling. Everyone wished to accompany Napoleon
to the East&mdash;civilians, scholars, engineers, artists,
all wished to make the journey. Napoleon selected and
equipped the army, raised money and collected ships.
He was employed night and day in the organization of
the armament which was to be under his command absolutely.</p>

<p>In April and May 1798 the various squadrons of the
French fleet were assembled at Toulon, and everything
was soon in readiness. The main body was assembled
at Toulon but the embarkment was to take place at
Civita Vecchia. When asked if he should remain long
in Egypt, Napoleon replied: "A few months, or six
years; it all depends upon circumstances."</p>

<p>When all was in readiness Bonaparte called his vast
army together and in sight of the ships which were to carry
them from the shores of France, said to his followers:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
"Rome fought Carthage on sea as well as on the land;
England is the Carthage of France. I have come to lead
you, in the name of the Divinity of Liberty, across mighty
seas, and into distant regions, where your valor may
achieve such life and glory as will never await you
beneath the cold skies of the West. Prepare yourselves,
soldiers, to embark under the tri-color for achievements
far more glorious than you have won for your country
on the blushing plains of Italy."</p>

<p>He agreed to give each soldier seven acres of land, and
as his promises had not hitherto been violated, the soldiers
heard him with joy, and prepared to obey him with
alacrity. They answered his address with loud cheers
and cries of, "Long live the Republic!" The English
government vigilantly observed the preparations that
were going on, and kept a fleet in the Mediterranean under
the command of Nelson. It was highly important that
the French squadron should sail without delay, in order
to avoid the risk of being discovered by the English
cruisers, but contrary winds detained it for ten days.
This interval was employed by Napoleon in attention to
the minutest details connected with the finely appointed
force under his command.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 19th of May, 1798, fortune
favored him, and the troops were all embarked, while the
English fleet, under Nelson, "the Neptune of the Seas,"
was compelled to go into port to repair ships disabled in
a violent gale. The French fleet, which was supplied
with water for a month, and with food for two months,
carried about 40,000 men of all sorts, and ten thousand
sailors. In the army were many veteran soldiers,
selected from the Army of Italy and commanded by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
first generals of France. Kléber, Desaix, Berthier, Regnier,
Murat, Lannes, Andreossi, Junot, Menou, and Belliard
all served in this campaign.</p>

<p>Josephine had accompanied her husband to Toulon, and
remained with him to the last moment; their farewell was
most affecting. As the last of the French troops stepped
on board, the sun rose with great brilliancy on the mighty
armament&mdash;one of those dazzling suns which the soldiers
often referred to with delight as "the suns of Napoleon,"
and sails were immediately set for the East.</p>

<p>On the 8th of June the convoys from Italy joined the
squadron out at sea; on the 10th the whole fleet was
assembled before Malta. The first object of Napoleon
was to take possession of that island. He had already
secured a secret party among the knights, and a very slight
demonstration of hostilities spread consternation among
them and they opened their gates to the French without
delay. Nearly all the knights entered the ranks of the
French army. As the French troops passed through the
almost impregnable fortifications General Caffarelli dryly
remarked to Napoleon that it was fortunate there was
some one to open the gates for them; had there been no
garrison at all, it would have been terrible hard work.</p>

<p>Leaving a sufficient garrison in Malta the French
squadron was again under sail on the 16th. While the
officers and savants devoted much time to the discussion
of military and scientific topics the great object of excitement
and solicitude was to elude the English fleet. The
French vessels were encumbered with civil and military
baggage, provisions, stores, etc., and densely crowded
with troops. Napoleon was anxious to avoid such an
encounter: "God grant that we may pass the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
without meeting them," he remarked to Admiral Brueyes.</p>

<p>Nelson was now in full pursuit. At Naples he heard of
their landing at Malta and that their destination was
Egypt. He arrived at Malta just after they had left the
island and missed overtaking them by an accident. During
a hazy night, on which they lay off Candia, the French
were alarmed by the report of guns on their starboard,
and it afterwards proved that those were signals between
the ships of Nelson's fleet, so close were the two hostile
squadrons to each other without being aware of it. Napoleon
received positive information of this proximity the
following morning and ordered Brueyes to steer at once
for Cape Aza, about twenty-five leagues distant from
Alexandria. This precaution foiled Nelson who crowded
sail for Alexandria.</p>

<p>Napoleon finally reached his destination on the first of
July undisturbed, the tops of the minarets of Alexandria
announcing that his point was gained. As he was reconnoitring
the coast at the very moment that danger seemed
over a strange sail appeared on the verge of the horizon:
"Fortune!" exclaimed he, "I ask but six hours more,&mdash;wilt
thou refuse them?" The vessel proved not to be
English, but French and the disembarkation, near a structure
called the tower of Marabout, three leagues to the
eastward of Alexandria, immediately took place in spite
of a violent gale and a tremendous surf. Egypt was then
nominally a province of the Porte, and governed by a
Turkish Pasha who was at peace with France.</p>

<p>Bonaparte met with no opposition in landing, and by
3 o'clock in the morning commenced his march upon
Alexandria with three divisions of his army. He had
little difficulty in entering Alexandria, although he met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
with resistance and General Kléber, who commanded the
attack, was wounded. The French lost about two hundred
men.</p>

<p>Bonaparte exacted of his troops, under penalty of death,
consideration of all the laws and religion of the country,
and to the people of Egypt he addressed a proclamation
in which he said: "They will tell you that I come to
destroy your religion; believe them not: I come to restore
your rights, to punish the usurpers, and I respect, more
than the Mamelukes ever did, God, his Prophet and the
Koran. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Thrice happy they who shall be with
us! Woe unto them that take up arms for the Mamelukes!&mdash;they
shall perish."</p>

<p>The Mamelukes were considered by Napoleon to be,
individually, the finest cavalry in the world. They rode
the noblest horses of Arabia, and were armed with the
best weapons which the world could produce: carbines,
pistols, etc., from England, and sabres of the steel of
Damascus. Their skill in horsemanship was equal to their
fiery valor. With that cavalry and the French infantry,
Bonaparte said it would be easy to conquer the world.</p>

<p>Napoleon himself remained some days in Alexandria
and left on the 7th of July, leaving Kléber in command,
being anxious to force the Mamelukes to an encounter
with the least possible delay. General Desaix was sent
forward with 4500 men to Beda. The commission of
learned men remained at Alexandria, until Napoleon
should reach Cairo, with the exception of Monge and
Berthollett who accompanied the commander.</p>

<p>The march over the burning sands of the desert
brought extreme misery and unheard-of sufferings to the
troops; the air was full of pestiferous insects, the glare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of the sand weakened the men's eyes, and water was scarce
and bad. Even the gallant spirits of Murat and Lannes
could not sustain themselves, and they trampled their brilliant
cockades in the sand in a fit of rage in the presence
of the troops. The common soldiers asked, with sarcastic
or angry murmurs, if it was here the general designed
to give them their "seven acres of land." "The rogue"
said they, "he might, with safety, have promised us as
much as we pleased; we should not abuse his good nature."
They, however, bore a grudge against Caffarelli, who
they thought had advised the expedition, and used to say,
as he hobbled past with his wooden leg, "He does not
care what happens; he is sure to have one foot at least in
France."</p>

<p>Napoleon alone was superior to all these evils. It
required, however, more than his example of endurance
and the general influence of his firm character to prevent
the army from breaking into open mutiny. "Once,"
said he at St Helena, "I threw myself amidst a group of
generals, and, addressing myself to the tallest of their
number with vehemence, said, 'You have been talking
sedition; take care lest I fulfill my duty; your five feet
ten inches would not hinder you from being shot within
two hours.'"</p>

<p>On the 10th of July, 1798, the army reached the Nile at
Rahmanié: "We no sooner saw the river," says Savary in
his memoirs, "than soldiers, officers and all rushed into
it; each, regardless whether it was sufficiently shallow to
afford security from danger, only sought to quench his
burning thirst, and stooped to drink from the stream, the
whole army presenting the appearance of a flock of
sheep." "We encamped," says Napoleon, "on immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
quantities of wheat, but there was neither mill nor oven
in the country." The men bruised the grain between
stones and baked it in the ashes or parched and boiled it.</p>

<p>The army soon moved on towards Cairo, but the men
were unable to leave the ranks for a single instant without
certain death from the spears or scimitars of those
matchless Mameluke horsemen; and, therefore, although
so near the Nile, several fell dead from thirst. But the
worriment of their minds was their worst evil. They
began to say there was no great city of Cairo; that they
believed it would prove only a collection of wretched huts.
In this state they came up, on the 13th, with the Mamelukes
at Chebreis. They were drawn up in battle array
under Mourad Bey, one of their most powerful chiefs, and
were a magnificent body of cavalry, glittering with gold
and silver and mounted on splendid horses.</p>

<p>The battle commenced without a moment's hesitation on
either side. Each Mameluke, feeling in himself the
valor of a host, rushed in the singleness of his purpose,
as if alone against the opposing mass; and with repeated
charges, endeavored, by every means of unbridled fury or
consummate skill, to break the solid squares of the French
army. They were at length beaten back with the loss
of about three hundred.</p>

<p>After the action at Chebreis the French army continued
to advance during eight days without opposition of any
enemy except the hovering Arabs who lay in wait for
every straggler from the main column. The order of
march towards Cairo was systematically arranged; each
division of the army moved forward in squares six men
deep on each side; the artillery was at the angles; and
in the centre the ammunition, the baggage, and the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
body of cavalry still remaining. Napoleon himself when
he rode always made use of a dromedary, though he at
first suffered a sensation resembling seasickness from its
peculiar motion. "I never passed the desert," said he
sometime later, "without experiencing very painful emotions.
It was the image of immensity to my thoughts.
It showed no limits. It had neither beginning nor end.
It was an ocean for the foot of man."</p>

<p>On the 19th of July the soldiers' eyes were gladdened
by the sight of the grand pyramids on the horizon.
Still advancing towards Cairo, the distant monuments
swelling upon the eye at every step, the army reached
Embabé on the 21st and found the Mamelukes in battle
array to dispute their further progress.</p>

<p>While every eye was fixed on these hoary monuments
of the past, Napoleon sighted with his glass a vast army
of the Beys spread out before him, the right posted on an
intrenched camp by the Nile, its centre and left composed
of that brilliant cavalry with which they were by this
time acquainted. Napoleon perceived, too, and what had
escaped the observation of all his staff, that the 40 pieces
of cannon on the intrenched camp of the enemy were
without carriages, and consequently could be leveled in
but one direction. He instantly decided on his plan of
attack by preparing to throw his forces on the left, where
the guns could not be available. Mourad Bey, who commanded
the Mamelukes, penetrated the French commander's
design, and his followers at once advanced
gallantly to the encounter.</p>

<p>"Soldiers, you are about to fight the rulers of Egypt,"
said Napoleon, as he raised his hands high in the air and
formed his troops into separate squares to meet the assault;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
"from the summits of yonder pyramids forty centuries
behold you." These imposing and mysterious witnesses
were not appealed to in vain, and the great battle began
at once at the foot of the ancient and gigantic monuments,
the French advancing in five grand squares, Napoleon
heading the centre square. In an instant the
Mamelukes came charging up with impetuous speed and
loud cries. They rushed on the line of bayonets, backed
their horses upon them, and at last, maddened by the
firmness which they could not shake, dashed their pistols
and carbines into the faces of the French troops.</p>

<p>The first manoeuvre of the French army disconcerted
the plans of the Mamelukes; still they continued to
charge. The places of the dead and dying were instantly
supplied by new warriors, who fell in their turn. They
daringly penetrated even between the spaces occupied by
the squares commanded by Regnier and Desaix, so that
the desperate horsemen were exposed to the incessant fire
of both faces of the divisions at the distance of fifty paces.
Many of the French fell from each other's fire in the
resistance to this act of desperation.</p>

<p>Those who had fallen wounded from their seats crawled
along the sand and hewed at the legs of their enemies
with their scimitars; but nothing could move the intrepid
French. Bayonets and the continued roll of musketry by
degrees thinned the host around them. When Bonaparte
at last advanced with his battalions upon the main
body, and divided one part from the other, such was the
confusion and terror of the Mamelukes that they abandoned
their works and flung themselves by hundreds into the
Nile. The carnage was prodigious, thousands were left
bleeding on the sands, and multitudes more were drowned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
It was the custom of the Mamelukes to carry their treasures
with them on their bodies when they went to battle,
and every one that fell made a French soldier rich
for life, as the bodies of the slain were all rifled. In his
report of the engagement, Bonaparte said: "After the
great number of battles in which the troops I command
have been opposed to superior strength, I cannot but
praise their discipline and coolness on this occasion; for
this novel species of warfare has made them display a
patience contrasting oddly with French impetuosity. If
they had given way to their ardor, they would not have
gained the victory, which was only to be obtained by
great calmness and patience. The cavalry of the Mamelukes
evinced great bravery. They defended their fortunes;
for there was not one of them upon whom our soldiers
did not find three, four or five hundred gold pieces."</p>

<p>Savary, who fought in Desaix's division, which had to
stand the first attack of the Mamelukes, has given a striking
description of the impression produced by their furious
onset. "Although," he says, "the troops that were
in Egypt had been long inured to danger, every one
present at the battle of the Pyramids must acknowledge,
if he be sincere, that the charge of the Mamelukes was
most awful, and that there was reason, at one moment,
to apprehend their breaking through our formidable
squares, rushing upon them, as they did, with a confidence
which enforced silence in our ranks, interrupted
only by the word of command. It seemed as if we must
inevitably be trampled in an instant under the feet of this
cavalry of Mamelukes, who were all mounted upon
splendid chargers, richly caparisoned with gold and silver
trappings, covered with draperies of all colors and waving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
scarfs, and who were bearing down upon us at full
gallop, rending the air with their cries. The whole
character of this imposing sight filled the breasts of our
soldiers with sensations to which they had hitherto been
strangers, and made them vividly attentive to the word of
command. The order to fire was executed with a quickness
and precision far exceeding what is exhibited in an
exercise or upon parade."</p>

<p>More than fifty pieces of cannon and four hundred
loaded camels became the spoil of the conquerors.</p>

<p>Mourad and a remnant of 2000 of his Mamelukes
retreated on Upper Egypt. These were all that escaped
with life out of the matchless body of men who in such
superb array had bid scornful defiance to the European
invaders only a few hours before. Cairo surrendered;
Lower Egypt was entirely conquered. Such were the
immediate consequences of the "Battle of the Pyramids."</p>

<p>Many of the promiscuous rabble of infantry reached
Cairo in advance of the French and there they spread
realistic accounts of the dreadful power of Napoleon and
his army.</p>

<p>The name of Bonaparte now spread panic through the
East, and the victor was considered invincible. The
inhabitants called him "King of Fire," from the deadly
effect of the musketry in the engagement at the Pyramids
which decided the conquest of the country. By the
earliest dawn the victor prepared to take possession of the
conquest he had made, but was spared all difficulties by
its unconditional surrender. A deputation of the shieks
and chief inhabitants waited upon him at his headquarters
in the country house of Mourad Bey, to implore his clemency
and submit to his power. He received them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the greatest kindness and informed them of his friendly
intentions towards them and that his hostility was entirely
confined to the Mamelukes.</p>

<p>Cairo and its citadel were immediately occupied by the
French troops, and on the 24th of July Napoleon made his
public entry into the capital, amidst a great concourse of
people.</p>

<p>The savants who accompanied Bonaparte on the expedition
lost no time in taking advantage of their opportunities,
and at once began to ransack the monuments of
antiquity, and founded collections which reflected much
honor on their zeal and skill. Napoleon himself, accompanied
by many officers of his staff, visited the interior of
the Great Pyramid of Cheops, attended by many muftis
and imans, and on entering the secret chamber in which,
three thousand years before, some Pharaoh had been
interred, repeated once more his confession of faith:
"There is no God but God, and Mohammed is his
Prophet." The learned Orientals who accompanied him
responded with sarcastic solemnity: "Thou hast spoken
like the most learned of the prophets; but God is merciful."</p>

<p>Ten days after the battle at the pyramids had been
fought and won, Nelson, who had scoured the Mediterranean
in quest of Napoleon, discovered the French fleet,
commanded by Admiral Brueyes, at anchor in the Bay of
Aboukir. A terrific engagement ensued, lasting twenty-four
hours, including a whole night. A solitary pause
occurred at midnight when the French ship <i>Orient</i>, a
superb vessel of 120 guns, took fire and blew up in the
heart of the conflicting squadrons, with an explosion that
for a moment silenced rage in awe. Admiral Brueyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
himself perished. The next morning two shattered ships,
out of all the French fleet, with difficulty made their
escape to the sea. The rest of the magnificent fleet was
utterly destroyed or remained in the hands of the English,
who have since called the engagement "The Battle of the
Nile."</p>

<p>The ships were arranged in a semi-circular compact line
of battle, and so close to the shore that Brueyes had supposed
it was impossible to get between them and the land;
but his daring enemy, who well knew all the surroundings,
soon convinced him of his mistake. The van of the English
fleet, six in number, successfully rounded the French line,
dropping anchor between it and the shore, and opened their
fire, while Nelson, with his other ships, ranged along it on
the outer side and so placed the French fleet between two
tremendous fires. Admiral Brueyes was wounded early
in the action, but continued to command with the utmost
energy. When he fell mortally wounded he would not
suffer himself to be carried below. "A French admiral
ought to die on his quarter-deck," he replied to the
entreaties of his friend Gantheaume who succeeded him.</p>

<p>It was on his return from Salahié to Cairo, whither
Napoleon had pursued the Mameluke chief, Ibrahim-Bey,
and defeated him, that he was met by a messenger, with
information of the destruction of the French fleet by
Nelson in the roads of Aboukir. It was a terrible blow
to Napoleon, who was thus shut off from all intercourse
with France; his soldiers were thus completely isolated,
hundreds of miles from home, and compelled to rely on
their own arms and the resources of Egypt. He had
been so anxious about the fleet as to write twice to
Admiral Brueyes to repeat the order that he should enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the harbor of Alexandria, or sail for Corfu; he had also,
previously to leaving Cairo, dispatched Julien, his aide-de-camp,
to enforce the order; but this unfortunate officer
was surrounded and killed, with his escort, at a village on
the Nile, where he had landed to obtain provisions.</p>

</div>

<p>A solitary sigh escaped Napoleon when he heard the
news. "To the army of France," said he, "the fates have
decreed the empire of the land&mdash;to England the sovereignty
of the seas." Some years later, on learning of the results
of the terrible naval battle at Trafalgar, in which Nelson
was again victorious, but which cost him his life, Napoleon
repeated this remark, adding, "Well, I cannot be
everywhere." The seamen who had landed at Alexandria
were now formed into a marine brigade, and made a
valuable addition to the army. Very soon afterwards the
Porte declared war against France.</p>

<p>Public improvements of various kinds were now begun
at Cairo and Alexandria under Bonaparte's direction,
and many continue to this day. In all quarters the
highest discipline was preserved; and Napoleon
exerted all the energy of his nature to increase
the resources which remained to him, and to preserve
and organize Egypt as a French province. "At each
step of his advance," says Savary, "General Bonaparte
quickly foresaw everything that was to be done to
render available the resources of the most fertile country
in the world and give them a suitable application." So
quickly had his mind recovered its tone that, on the 21st
of August (only a week after he had learned of the
destruction of his fleet at Aboukir), he founded an Institute
at Cairo exactly on the model of that learned society
in France. Monge was president; Napoleon himself,
vice-president.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>At Cairo a terrible insurrection occurred on the 21st of
October, but it was soon put down by the French troops,
after a bitter struggle in which many soldiers lost their
lives. Napoleon was in the thickest of the conflict on
horseback in the centre of thirty Guides and soon restored
confidence among his soldiers. Tranquility was restored
in three days, after which many of the leaders were put
to death. The others were pardoned.</p>

<p>Napoleon now proceeded to explore the Isthmus of
Suez, where a narrow neck of land divides the Red Sea
from the Mediterranean. He visited the Maronite Monks
of Mount Sinai, and, as Mohammed had done before him,
affixed his name to their charter of privileges; he examined,
also, the Fountains of Moses, and on the 28th of
December, 1798, nearly lost his life in exploring, during
low water, the sands of the Red Sea, where Pharaoh is
supposed to have perished while in pursuit of the Hebrews.
"The night overtook us," says Savary, "the waters
began to rise around us; the Guard in advance exclaimed
that their horses were swimming. Bonaparte saved us all
by one of those simple expedients which occur to an
imperturbable mind. Placing himself in the centre he
bade all the rest circle around him, and then ride out,
each man in a separate direction, and each to halt as soon
as he found his horse swimming. The man whose horse
continued to march the last, was sure, he said, to be in
the right direction; then accordingly we all followed, and
reached Suez at two in the morning in safety, though so
rapidly had the tide advanced that the water was at the
breastplate of our horses ere we made the land." In
referring to this narrow escape from sharing the fate of
Pharaoh, Napoleon remarked to Las Casas: "This would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
have furnished all the preachers in Christendom with a
splendid text against me."</p>

<p>On his return to Cairo Bonaparte dispatched a trusty
messenger into India, inviting Tippoo Saib to inform him
of the condition of the English army in that section, and
declaring that Egypt was only the first port in a march
destined to surpass that of Alexander. According to his
secretary, "he spent whole days in lying flat on the
ground stretched on maps of Asia."</p>

<p>After having passed the balance of the year at Cairo
the commander declared the time for action had now
arrived. Leaving 15,000 men in and about Cairo, the
division of Desaix in Upper Egypt, and garrisons in the
chief towns, Bonaparte, on the 11th of February, 1799,
marched for Syria at the head of 10,000 picked men, with
the intention of crushing the Turkish armaments in that
quarter before their chief force, which he learned was assembling
at Rhodes, should have time to reach Egypt by sea.</p>

<p>The hostility of the Porte, which would of course be
encouraged and assisted by England, implied impending
danger on two points,&mdash;the approach of a Turkish army
via Syria and the landing of another on the coast of the
Mediterranean, under the protection of British ships.
The necessity of forestalling their designs by an expedition
to Syria was therefore apparent. In January, 1799, two
Turkish armies were assembled; one at Rhodes; the
other in Syria. The former was intended to make a
descent upon the coast of Egypt at Aboukir, the latter
had already pushed forward its advance guard to El-Arisch,
a fort within the Egyptian territory, had established
large magazines at Gaza and landed at Jaffa a train
of artillery of forty guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Traversing the desert, seventy-five leagues across, which
divides Egypt from Syria, with about twelve thousand
men, one regiment being mounted on dromedaries, Napoleon
took possession of the fortress El-Arisch on February
17th, after a vigorous assault. The march was made rapidly
and in good order. Having resolved upon an immediate
expedition into Syria, he did not wait to be attacked on
both sides at the same time; but, according to his usual custom,
determined to push forward and encounter one division
of his enemies at a time. He addressed two letters to
the Pasha of Syria, surnamed Djezzar or "the Butcher,"
from his horrible cruelties, offering him friendship and
alliance, but the pasha observed a contemptuous silence as
to the first communication, and replied to the second in his
favorite fashion&mdash;seized the messenger and cut off his head.
There was, consequently, nothing to be done with Djezzar
but to fight him with such generals as Kléber, Bessieres,
Caffarelli, Murat, Lannes, Junot and Berthier.</p>

<p>Pursuing his march, Napoleon took Gaza, the ancient
city of the Philistines, without serious opposition, although
three or four thousand of Djezzar's horse were drawn up
to oppose them. At Jaffa, the Joppa of Holy Writ, the
Moslems made a resolute defense, on March 6th, but at
length the walls were carried by storm. Three thousand
Turks died with arms in their hands in defense of the
city, and the town was given up for three hours to pillage
more savage than Napoleon had ever before permitted.
This was followed by a massacre of hundreds of the
barbarians who were marched out of Jaffa some distance
from the town, in the centre of a battalion under General
Bon, divided into small parties and shot or bayoneted to a
man. Like true fatalists they submitted in silence, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
their bodies were gathered into a pyramid where for half
a century their bones were still visible in the whitening
sand.</p>

<p>Napoleon, while admitting that the act was one of the
darkest stains on his name that he had to acknowledge,
still justified himself on the double plea that he could not
afford soldiers to guard so many prisoners&mdash;estimated variously
from 1200 to 3,000&mdash;and that he could not grant
them the benefit of parole because they were the very men
who had already been set free by him on such terms at
El-Arisch after they had given their word not to serve
against him for a year. "Now," said Napoleon at St.
Helena, "if I had spared them again and sent them away
on their parole, they would directly have gone to St. Jean
d'Acre, where they would have played me over again the
same trick that they had done at Jaffa. In justice to the
lives of my soldiers, since every general ought to consider
himself as their father, and them as his children, I could
not allow this. To leave as a guard a portion of my army,
already small and reduced in number, in consequence of
the breach of faith of those wretches, was impossible. I
therefore *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* ordered that the prisoners should be
singled out and shot. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I would do the same
thing to-morrow and so would any general commanding
an army under such circumstances."</p>

<p>Napoleon now ascertained that the Pasha of Syria was
at St. Jean d'Acre, so renowned in the history of the Crusades,
and determined to defend that place to extremity
with the force which had already been assembled for the
invasion of Egypt. Sir Sidney Smith, with two ships of
war, was cruising before the port and the garrison was
assisted by European science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The French army moved on Acre, eager for revenge,
while the necessary apparatus of a siege was ordered to
be sent round by sea from Alexandria. Sir Sidney Smith
was informed by Djezzar, of the approaching storm, and
hastened to support him in the defense of Acre. Napoleon's
vessels, conveying guns and stores from Egypt, fell
into his hands and he appeared off the town two days before
the French army came in view of it. He was permitted
to regulate the plan of defense, turning Napoleon's own
cannon against him from the walls.</p>

<p>Napoleon commenced the siege on the 18th of March
and opened his trenches immediately on his arrival. "On
that little town," he said to one of his generals, as they
were standing together on an eminence, "On yonder little
town depends the fate of the East: behold the key of
Constantinople or of India." "The moment Acre falls,"
he said about the same time to Bourrienne, "all the
Druses of Mount Lebanon will join me; the Syrians,
weary of Djezzar's oppressions, will crowd to my
standard: I shall march upon Constantinople with an
army to which the Turks can offer no effectual resistance,
and it is not unlikely that I may return to France by the
route of Adrianople and Vienna, destroying the house of
Austria on my way."</p>

<p>For ten days the French labored hard in their trenches,
being exposed to the fire of extensive batteries, formed
chiefly of Bonaparte's own artillery. On March 28th, however,
a breach was at last effected and the French mounted
with such fiery zeal that the garrison gave way. Shortly
afterwards Djezzar himself appeared on the battlements,
and flinging his pistols at the head of his flying men, urged
and compelled them to renew the defense, which they
finally did, causing the French to retreat with great loss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime Junot, having marched with his division
to encounter a large Mussulman army that had been
gathered among the mountains of Samaria, and was preparing
to descend upon Acre, Napoleon was compelled to
follow him to Nazareth, where he was rescued on April
8th. Here, as usual, the splendid cavalry of the Orientals
were unable to resist the solid squares and well-directed
musketry of the French. General Kléber, with another
division, was in like manner rescued by the general-in-chief
at Mount Thabor on April 15th, after the former
had fought against fearful odds from six in the morning
till one in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Napoleon now returned to the siege of Acre with all
possible dispatch, pressed it on with desperate assaults day
after day, losing many of his best soldiers. Accustomed
to the easy victories which he had obtained on every
encounter with the Turkish forces in Syria, he was not
prepared to expect the determined resistance by which his
progress was now arrested. Acre is surrounded by a wall
flanked with towers, and was further defended by a broad
and deep ditch with strong works. At one time the
French succeeded in forcing their way into the great
tower and in establishing themselves in one part of it for
a time despite all opposition; but they were finally dislodged;
each advantage ended with itself and no progress
was made towards subduing the place. At another time a
break was made in the walls in a distant part of the town,
and a French party entered Acre at the opening. Djezzar
then threw such a crowd of Turks upon them that all discipline
was lost and nearly every French soldier met death.
The brave Lannes, who headed the party, was with difficulty
rescued after being desperately wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>During this siege Napoleon sent an officer with an
order to the most exposed position; he was killed.
He sent another, who was also killed; and so with
a third. The order was imperative and Bonaparte had
but two aides with him, Eugene Beauharnais and Lavalette.
He signaled to the latter to come forward, and said
to him in a low voice, so that Eugene could not hear:
"Take this order, Lavalette, I don't want to send this
boy and have him killed so young; his mother (Josephine)
has intrusted him to me. You know what life is. Go!"
The aide returned in safety.</p>

<p>On another occasion during the siege a piece of
shell struck Eugene on the head: he fell, and lay
for a long time under the ruins of a wall which the
shell had knocked down. Bonaparte thought he was
killed, and uttered a cry of grief. The youth was only
wounded, however, and at the end of nineteen days
asked leave to return to his post, in order to take part in
the other assaults, which failed like the first, in spite of
Bonaparte's obstinacy. "This wretched hole," said he,
"has cost me a good deal of time and a great many men,
but things have gone too far; I must try one last assault."</p>

<p>An instance of the enthusiastic attachment which Napoleon
was capable of inspiring occurred during this memorable
siege. One day, when the commander was in the
trenches, a shell thrown by Sir Sidney Smith, fell at his
feet. Two grenadiers immediately rushed towards him,&mdash;placed
him between them, and raised their arms above
his head so as to completely cover every part of his body.
The shell burst without injuring one of the group,
although they were covered with sand. Both these grenadiers
were made officers immediately; one of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
subsequently, was the General Dumesnil, so much talked
of 1814, for his resolute defense of Vincennes against the
Russians. He had lost a leg in the campaign of Moscow;
and to the summons to surrender he replied, "Give me
back my leg and I will give up the fortress!" The fate
of his heroic companion is not recorded.</p>

<p>The siege had now continued for sixty days. Napoleon
once more commanded an assault on the 8th of May, and
his officers and soldiers obeyed him with devoted but
fruitless gallantry. "That Sidney Smith," he said later,
"made me miss my fortune." The loss his army had by
this time undergone was very great, and the hearts of
all the men were quickly sinking.</p>

<p>Among the officers and men who fell on this memorable
8th of May was Croisier, the aide-de-camp, who had
incurred the commander's displeasure at Jaffa. Napoleon
had once before been violently irritated against him for
some seeming neglect at Cairo, and the word "coward"
had escaped him. The feelings of Croisier, then deeply
affected had become insupportable since the event at Jaffa,
and he sought death at every opportunity. On this day
Napoleon observed the tall figure of his unfortunate aide-de-camp
mounted on a battery, exposed to the thickest
of the enemy's fire, and called loudly and imperatively,
"Croisier, come down! you have no business there."
Croisier neither replied nor moved; the next instant he
received his death wound.</p>

<p>A Turkish fleet had now arrived to reinforce Djezzar,
and upon the utter failure of the attack of the 21st of May,
the eleventh different attempt to carry the place by assault,
Napoleon yielded to stern necessity, raised the siege, and
began his retreat upon Jaffa. On leaving this latter place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
some six days after, a number of plague patients in the
hospitals were found to be in a state that held out no hope
of their recovery, and the commander, unwilling to leave
them to the cruel practices of the Turks, suggested that
opium be administered by one of the medical staff as a
speedy death.</p>

<p>The various accounts of this incident in no way agree
in detail. Bonaparte denied at St. Helena that the opium
was given, but said that the patients, seven in number
were abandoned. He declared also, that if his own son
had been among the number he would have advised that
it be done rather than to leave them to suffer the tortures
of the Turks. Sir Sidney Smith found seven alive in the
hospitals when he came up. A rear guard had been left
to protect them and they probably galloped off before
the English entered the place. Bourrienne, who acted
as secretary to Napoleon at this time, gives a different
account, while others assert that 500 men were thus disposed
of. The real facts will probably never be known
although both Hazlitt and Sir Walter Scott acquit Napoleon
of all blame after a careful investigation of all the
facts. That Bonaparte's motives were good his enemies
generally admit, as he seems to have designed, by shortening
these men's lives, to do them the best service in
his power.</p>

<p>The retreating march was a continued scene of misery;
the wounded and sick were many, the heat oppressive,
and the burdens almost intolerable. Dejected by the
sight of so much suffering Napoleon issued an order that
every horse, mule and camel should be given up to the
sick, wounded and infected. Shortly afterwards one of
his attendants came to ask which horse he wished to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
reserve for himself. "Scoundrel!" the commander cried,
"do you not know the order? Let every one march on
foot&mdash;I the first! Begone!" He accordingly, during the
rest of the march, walked by the side of the sick, cheering
them to hope for recovery, and exhibiting to all the
soldiery the example at once of endurance and compassion.
As he had done in Italy, Napoleon always shared
the privations and fatigue of the army and their extremities
were sometimes so great that the troops were compelled to
contend with each other for the smallest comforts. Upon
one occasion in the desert, the soldiers would scarcely allow
their general to dip his hands in a muddy pool of water;
and when passing the ruins of Pelusium, almost suffocated
by heat, a soldier yielded him the ruins of an
ancient doorway beneath which he contrived to shade his
head for a few minutes and which Napoleon observed,
"was no trifling favor."</p>

<p>On the march between Cesarea and Jaffa, Napoleon
very narrowly escaped death. Many of the men had
by this time regained their horses, owing to the continual
death of the wretched objects who had been mounted
upon them. The commander was so exhausted that he
had fallen asleep on his horse. A little before daybreak, a
native, concealed among the bushes close to the roadside,
took aim at his head, and fired. The ball missed:
the man was pursued, caught and ordered to be instantly
shot. Four Guides drew their triggers, but all their carbines
hung fire, owing to the extreme humidity of the
night. The Syrian leaped into the sea, which was close
to the road; swam to a ledge of rocks, which he mounted
and there stood, undaunted and untouched by the shots
of the whole troop, who fired at him as they pleased.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Napoleon left Bourrienne behind to wait for Kléber, who
formed the rear guard and to order him "not to forget the
Naplousian." It is not certain that he was shot at last.</p>

<p>On his return to Cairo on the 14th of June, 1799,
after a march of twenty-five days, Napoleon once
more re-established himself in his former headquarters;
but he had not long occupied himself with the establishment
of a new government for Egypt which was then in
a state of perfect tranquility, when word came to him of a
probable uprising at Alexandria. The commander
therefore decided to go there at once. He arrived on the
24th of July and found his army posted in the neighborhood
of Aboukir, prepared to anticipate an attack of
the Turks which had appeared off Aboukir under the
protection of two British ships commanded by Sir Sidney
Smith, on the morrow. Surveying their intrenched camp
from the heights above, the commander said to Murat;
"Go how it may, the battle of tomorrow will decide the
fate of the world." "Of this army at least," answered
Murat; "but the Turks have no cavalry, and if ever
infantry were charged to the teeth by horse, they shall be
so by mine," a promise which the brave cavalry leader
made good.</p>

<p>Next morning the Turkish outposts were attacked and
the enemy driven in with great slaughter. The retreat
might have ended in a rout but for the eagerness of the
enemy who engaged in the task of spoiling and maiming
those who fell before them. This gave to Murat the
opportunity of charging the main body,&mdash;which had been
drawn up in battle array on the field,&mdash;in flank with his
cavalry. From that moment the engagement was no
longer a battle but a massacre. The French infantry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
under the rallying eye of Napoleon, forced a passage to
the intrenchments, and attacking the Turks on all sides,
caused them to throw themselves headlong into the
waves, rather than await the fury of the French
cavalry and the steady fire of the artillery. The sea at
first appeared literally covered with turbans. It was only
when weary with slaughter that quarter was given to
about 6,000 men&mdash;the rest of the Turkish army, consisting
of 18,000 having perished on the field or in the sea.
Six thousand were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>The defeat of the Turks at Aboukir filled the French
soldiers at Cairo with extreme rapture; Murat was
promoted to the rank of a general of division and
Napoleon ordered his name and that of Roize and the
numbers of the regiments of cavalry present at the battle,
engraved upon pieces of brass cannon. Mustapha Pasha,
the commanding general of the Turks, on being brought
into the presence of his victor, was saluted with these
words: "It has been your fate to lose this day; but I
will take care to inform the sultan of the courage with
which you have contested it."</p>

<p>"Spare thyself that trouble," answered the proud pasha,
"my master knows me better than thou." On the evening
after the battle, General Kléber embraced Bonaparte
and said to him, "General, you are as great as the
world!" "It is not written on high that I am to perish
by the hands of the Arabs," replied Napoleon.</p>

<p>This splendid and most decisive victory at Aboukir concluded
Bonaparte's career in the East. It was imperiously
necessary, ere he could have ventured to quit the command
of the army, that he should have to his credit some such
glory after the retreat from Syria. It preserved his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
credit with the public and enabled him to state that
he left Egypt for the time in absolute security.
After the engagement Napoleon sent a flag of truce
to Sir Sidney Smith, and an interchange of civilities commenced
between the English and the French. This
circumstance, trifling in itself, led to important consequences.
Among other things, a copy of a French journal,
dated the 10th of June 1799 was sent ashore by Sir Sidney
Smith. No news from France had reached Egypt for ten
months. Napoleon seized the paper with eagerness and
its contents verified his worst fears; he had said some time
before while at Acre that he feared France was in trouble.
As he opened the paper he exclaimed: "My God! My
presentiment is realized; the imbeciles have lost Italy! All
the fruits of our victories are gone! I must leave Egypt."
He then spent the whole night in his tent reading a file of the
English newspapers which had been furnished him. From
these he learned of Suwarrow's victories over the French
in Italy and of the disastrous internal state of France. In
the morning Admiral Gantheaume received hasty orders to
prepare the two frigates <i>Muiron</i> and <i>Carrére</i> and two corvetts,
for sea, with the utmost secrecy and dispatch,
furnishing them with two months provisions for five hundred
men.</p>

<p>Napoleon returned to Cairo on the 9th of August, but it
was only to make some parting arrangements as to the
administration of affairs there, for he had resolved to intrust
Egypt to other hands, and at once set out for France.
He reached Alexandria once more, and was there met by
those whom he had decided should make the return voyage
with him. He selected Berthier, Lannes, Murat,
Marmont and Andréossy with five hundred picked men to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
accompany him: these with Monge and Denon proceeded
to depart from Alexandria without delay. On the 18th a
courier from Gantheaume brought information that Sir
Sidney Smith had left the coast to take water at Cyprus.
This was the signal for Napoleon's instant departure.</p>

<p>On the morning of August 23d, 1799, Bonaparte and his
chosen followers embarked at Rosetta on two frigates and
two smaller vessels, which had been saved in the harbor of
Alexandria. A lack of water, and an accident to one of
the English ships had compelled the enemy to raise the
blockade and so favored his departure. In writing to the
Divan and announcing his departure he said: "Remind
the Musselmen frequently of my love for them. Acquaint
them that I have two great means to conduct men&mdash;persuasion
and force; with the one I gain friends, and with the
other I destroy my enemies."</p>

<p>General Kléber was now placed in command of the
Army of Egypt by Napoleon who informed his successor
of the reasons of his departure for France, and his intention
of sending recruits and munitions at the earliest possible
moment. He said to Kléber, "The army which I
confide to you is composed of my children; in all times,
even in the midst of the greatest sufferings I have received
the mark of their attachment; keep alive in them these
sentiments. You owe this to the particular esteem and
true attachment which I bear myself towards you."</p>

<p>The French frigates had hardly passed from sight of
land when they were reconnoitred by an English corvette,
a circumstance which seemed of evil augury. Bonaparte
assured his companions by his usual allusions to his own
"destiny" which he declared would protect him on sea
as well as land. "We will arrive safe," said he, "for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>tune
will never abandon us&mdash;we will arrive safe despite
the enemy."</p>

<p>Napoleon left no responsibility upon the admiral to
whom the various manoeuvres have been ascribed: "As
if," says Bourrienne, "any one could command when
Bonaparte was present!"</p>

<p>By express directions of Napoleon, the squadron,
instead of taking the ordinary course, kept close to the
African coast, in the direction of the southern point of
Sardinia; his intention being to take a northerly course
along the northern coast of that island. He had irrevocably
determined, that should the English fleet appear, he
would run ashore; make his way, with the little army
under his command, to Orin, Tunis, or some other port;
and thence find another opportunity of getting to
France.</p>

<p>The entire voyage was one of constant peril, for the
Mediterranean was traversed in all directions by English
ships of war. For twenty-one days, adverse winds, blowing
from west or northwest, continually drove the squadron
on the Syrian coast, or back towards Alexandria. It
was once proposed that they should again put into that
port, but Napoleon would not hear of it, declaring that
he would brave any danger. On the 30th of September
he reached Ajaccio, and was received with enthusiasm at
the place of his birth; but according to his own phrase,
"it rained cousins" and he was wearied with solicitations.
"What will become of me," he said, "if the English, who
are cruising hereabouts, should learn that I have landed
in Corsica? I shall be forced to stay here. That I could
never endure. I have a torrent of relations pouring upon
me." "His brilliant reputation," says Bourrienne, "had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
prodigiously augmented his family connections, and from
the great number of his pretended god-children it might
have been thought that he had held one-fourth of the
children of Ajaccio at the baptismal font." It was during
his stay in Corsica that Napoleon first heard of the loss
of the battle of Novi by the French army and of the death
of Joubert. "But for that confounded quarantine" he
exclaimed, "I would hasten ashore, and place myself at
the head of the Army of Italy. All is not over; and I
am sure that there is not a general who would refuse me
the command. The news of the victory gained by me,
would reach Paris as soon as the battle of Aboukir; that,
indeed, would be excellent!"</p>

</div>

<p>On the 7th of October the voyage was at last resumed,
the winds being again favorable, and on the morning of
the 9th, after a narrow escape from the English, he moored
in safety in the bay of Fréjus.</p>

<p>The story he brought of the victory of Aboukir, gave new
fuel to the flame of universal enthusiasm, and Napoleon's
return to Paris bore all the appearance of a triumphal procession.
The shouts of welcome with which he was hailed
were echoed by the whole population of France. He returned
from Egypt as a "conqueror," although almost alone;
yet Providence designed in this apparently deserted condition
that he should be the instrument of more astonishing
changes than the greatest efforts of the greatest conquerors
had ever before been able to effect upon the civilized
world. Napoleon was regarded as the champion of
liberty, as well as the successful military leader; and
none of his actions, or expressed opinions had as yet contradicted
such an estimation of his principles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>The campaign in Egypt was of little service to France,
but to Napoleon it was most useful. Of the aides-de-camp
whom he took with him four perished there,
Croisier, Sulkowski, Guibert and Julian; two, Duroc and
Eugene Beauharnais were wounded; Lavalette and Merlin
alone returned safe and sound. Bonaparte had the
highest regard for Josephine's son Eugene. He was
brave and manly, and although a youth of seventeen soon
won Bonaparte's lasting affection. If there was a dangerous
duty,&mdash;to ride into the desert and reconnoitre the
bands of Arabs or Mamelukes, Eugene was always the
first to volunteer. One day when he was hastening forward
with his usual eagerness, Bonaparte called him back,
saying: "Young man, remember that in our business we
must never <i>seek</i> danger; we must be satisfied with doing
our duty, doing it well, and leaving the rest to God!"</p>

<p>At the capital Napoleon was received with every demonstration
of joy by the French people, who now looked
upon him as their liberator. All parties seemed to be
weary of the Directory, and to demand the decisive interference
of the unrivalled soldier. On his return
he was much surprised to learn of the real condition
of France, and to an emissary of Barras he
said with some degree of feeling: "What have you done
with that land of France which I left to your care in so
magnificent a condition? I bequeathed you peace, and on
my return find war. I left you the memory of victories,
and now I have come back to face defeats. I left with
you the millions I had gathered in Italy, and today I see
nothing in every direction but laws despoiling the people,
coupled with distress. What have you done with the
one hundred thousand of French citizens, my companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
in glory, all of whom I knew? You have sent them to
their death. This state of things cannot last; for it
would lead us to despotism, and we require liberty reposing
on a basis of equality." The Directory offered him
the choice of any army he would command. He did not
refuse, but pleaded the necessity of a short interval of
leisure for the recovery of his health and speedily withdrew
from the conference in order to avoid any more such
embarrassing offers. He had by this time, evidently, a
very clear perception of the course before him, and had
made up his mind to place himself in circumstances to
confer high offices and commands, instead of accepting
them.</p>

<p>In talking afterwards to Madame de Rémusat about
this period in his career, Napoleon said: "The Directory
was not uneasy at my return; I was extremely on my
guard, and never in my life have I displayed more skill.
Everyone ran into my traps, and when I became the head
of the State there was not a party in France that did not
base its hopes on my success."</p>

PASSAGE OF THE ALPS, AND BATTLE
OF MARENGO</h2>

<p class="p2">At the time of Napoleon's return from the Egyptian
expedition the legislative bodies of Paris were divided
into two parties, the Moderates, headed by Sieyes, and
the Democrats, by Barras. Finding it impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
remain neutral, Bonaparte took sides with the former.
Lucien, his brother, had just been elected president of the
Council of Five Hundred; the subtle and able Talleyrand
and the accomplished Sieyes were his confidants, and he
determined to overwhelm the imbecile government and
take the reins in his own hands. He had measured his
strength, established his purpose, and, as France stood in
need of a more energetic and regenerated government, he
now went calmly to its execution.</p>

<p>During his absence in Egypt France had cause to deplore
the loss of his military genius, and had hailed his return
with rapturous acclamations. Napoleon's intentions were
no sooner suspected than he was surrounded by all those
who were discontented with the established government,
and who found in him such a leader as they had long
looked for in vain.</p>

<p>He soon opened negotiations with Sieyes who commanded
a majority in the Council of Ancients, and had
no sooner convinced him that the project of overturning
the Directorial government was his object, than he
was regarded as the instrument destined to give France
that "systematic" constitution he had so long deliberated
on and desired. Napoleon's overtures were therefore cordially
met, and Sieyes gave all the weight of his influence
to the impending revolution. Two men whose names
have since been known all over Europe, were also added
to the number of his adherents, Talleyrand, who had
been recently deposed from a place in the ministry; and
Fouché, minister of police. The talents of both were
actively employed in his service and materially promoted
his success. He had no faith in Fouché and used him
without giving him his confidence. Lucien Bonaparte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
held the important post of president of the Council of
Five Hundred; a circumstance highly advantageous to
his brother at this juncture. It was there that the greatest
opposition would be made to any attempt which was
hostile to the Constitution of the Year Three.</p>

<p>A large portion of the army was certain to side with
Napoleon. His house was now the resort of all the
generals and men of note who had served under him in
his campaigns in Italy and Egypt, Bernadotte alone standing
aloof.</p>

<p>A meeting took place between Napoleon and Sieyes on
the 6th of November 1799, in which it was finally
determined that the revolution should be attempted on the
9th. This date, called in the history of the period, the
18th Brumaire, was exactly one month from the day of
Napoleon's landing at Fréjus on his return from Egypt.
The measures resolved upon were as follows: The
Council of Ancients, taking advantage of an article
in the constitution, which authorized the measure, were
to decree the removal of the legislative bodies to St. Cloud,
beyond the walls of the city. They were next to appoint
Napoleon commander-in-chief of their own guard, of
the troops of the military division of Paris, and of the
National Guard. These decrees were to be passed at
seven in the morning; at eight Napoleon was to go to the
Tuileries, where the troops should be assembled, and there
assume the command of the capital.</p>

<p>The Council of Ancients at length gathered in the
Tuileries at an early hour, every arrangement having
been made in accordance with these resolutions, declared
that the salvation of the State demanded vigorous measures,
and proposed through its president, (one of Napo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>leon's
confidants)&mdash;the passage of the decrees already
agreed upon. The decrees were at once adopted without
debate and Napoleon notified. All had occurred as had
been prearranged. Early on the morning of the 18th
Brumaire, the house of Napoleon in the Rue de la Victoire
was crowded with a large assemblage of officers. It
was too small to hold them all and many were in the
court-yard and entrances. Numbers of these were devoted
to him; a few were in the secret, and all began to suspect
that something extraordinary was soon to happen.
Every one was in uniform except Bernadotte who
appeared in plain clothes. Displeased at this mark of
separation from the rest Napoleon said hastily: "How
is this? You are not in uniform!"</p>

<p>"I never am on a morning when I am not on duty,"
replied Bernadotte.</p>

<p>"You will be on duty presently," rejoined Napoleon.</p>

<p>"I have not heard of it; I should have received my
orders sooner," came the answer quickly.</p>

<p>Napoleon now drew him aside, disclosed his plans and
invited him to take part with the new movement against
a detested government. Bernadotte's only answer was
that "he would not take part in a rebellion," and with
some reluctance made a half promise of neutrality.</p>

<p>The moment the decrees of the Council of Ancients
arrived Napoleon came forward to the steps of his house,
read the documents, and invited them all to follow him to
the Tuileries. The enthusiasm of those present was now
at the highest pitch and all the officers drew their swords,
promising their services and fidelity. Napoleon instantly
mounted, and placed himself at the head of the generals
and officers. Attended by one thousand five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
horse, he halted on the boulevard at the corner of the
street Mont Blanc; he then dispatched some confidential
troops under Moreau to guard the Luxembourg, and the
Directory ceased to exist, although Barras entered a mild
protest and then retired to his country residence to live
upon the great spoils of his office.</p>

<p>The Council of Five Hundred, an hour or two afterwards,
assembled to learn its fate. Resistance would
have been idle, and adjourning for their next session at St.
Cloud, they mingled with the enthusiastic people shouting,
"Vive la République!" When they assembled at St.
Cloud the next morning they found that beautiful chateau
completely invested by the brilliant battalions under the
orders of Murat.</p>

<p>At about one o'clock on the 19th Brumaire Napoleon
appeared at St. Cloud attended by Berthier, Lefebvre,
Lannes and all the generals in his confidence. Upon his
arrival he learned that a heated debate had commenced in
the Council of Ancients on the subject of the resignation
of the directors and the immediate election of others.
Napoleon hastily entered the hall accompanied only by
Berthier and Bourrienne who attended as his secretary.
He addressed the body with much difficulty and
after many dramatic interruptions, told them that it
was upon them he relied, declaring his belief that the
Council of Five Hundred&mdash;corresponding in part with
the lower house of Congress&mdash;would restore the Convention,
popular tumults, the scaffold, the Reign of Terror.
"I will save you from all these horrors," he said, "I and
my brave comrades, whose swords and caps I see at the
door of this hall; and if any hireling traitor talks of outlawry,
to those swords will I appeal. You stand over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
volcano. Let a soldier tell the truth frankly. I was
quiet in my home when this Council summoned me to
action. I obeyed: I collected my brave comrades, and
placed the arms of my country at the service of you who
are its head. We are repaid with calumnies&mdash;they
talk of Cromwell&mdash;of Caesar. Had I aspired to power the
opportunity was mine ere now. I swear that France
holds no more devoted patriot. Dangers surround us.
Let us not hazard the advantages for which we have paid
so dearly&mdash;Liberty and Equality!" Rallying at the
uproar which pursued him to the door, Napoleon turned
round and called upon the Council to assist him in saving
the country; and with the words, "Let those who love
me follow," he passed quickly out, reached the courtyard
where he showed the soldiers the order naming
him commander-in-chief, and then leaped upon his horse,
shouts of "Vive Bonaparte!" resounding on all sides.</p>

<p>In the meantime the hostile Council of Five Hundred
had assembled, and there a far different scene was passing.
With the same steadiness of purpose and calmness
of manner, Bonaparte walked into the chamber
with two grenadiers on either side, who halted at the
doors that were left open, while the general advanced
towards the centre of the chamber.</p>

<p>At the sight of drawn swords at the passageway, and
the presence of armed men at the doors of that deliberative
body, loud cries of "Down with the traitor!" "Long
live the Constitution!" etc., broke forth. Several of the
members rushed upon Napoleon, some seized him by the
collar and one is said to have attempted his life with a
dagger. In an instant the grenadiers rushed forward
exclaiming, "Let us save our general," and bore their
commander from the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Napoleon was quickly in the midst of his soldiers and
found ready ears and enthusiastic spirits to listen to his
excited words. "Soldiers," he said, "I offered them victory
and fame&mdash;they have answered me with daggers."</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Augereau, whose faith in
his former general's fortune began to waver, is said to
have addressed him with the words, "A fine situation you
have brought yourself into!" Upon which Napoleon
answered, "Augereau, things were worse at Arcola; take
my advice, remain quiet; in a short time all this will
change."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the commotion in the Council of Five Hundred
rose to the highest pitch, a scene of the wildest confusion
was taking place in the Assembly, and the grenadiers
sent by Napoleon once more entered and bore Lucien,
the president, from his colleagues. They had charged
him with conspiracy and were about to vent their fury
upon him, when he flung off the insignia of his office and
was rescued.</p>

<p>Lucien found the soldiery without in a high state of
excitement. He mounted a horse quickly that he might
be seen and heard the better, and dramatically addressed
the assembled troops: "General Bonaparte, and you, soldiers
of France," he said, "the President of the Council
of Five Hundred announces to you that factious men with
daggers interrupt the deliberations of the Senate. He
authorizes you to employ force. The Assembly of Five
Hundred is dissolved." The soldiers received his harangue
with shouts of, "Vive Bonaparte!" Still there was
an appearance of hesitation, and it did not seem certain
that they were ready to act against the representatives of
the people, till Lucien drew his sword, and vehemently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
exclaimed, "I swear that I will stab my own brother to the
heart, if he ever attempts anything against the liberty of
Frenchmen."</p>

<p>This statement roused the soldiers to action and they
were now ready to obey any order from Napoleon. At a
signal from him, Murat, at the head of a body of grenadiers,
at once started to execute the order of the president.
With a roll of drums and leveled pieces, Lucien followed
the detachment, mounted the tribune, and dispersed the
Council of Five Hundred. The deputies were debating
in a state of wild indecision and anxiety when the troops
slowly entered. Murat, as they moved forward,
announced to the Council that it should disperse. A few
of the members instantly retired; but the majority
remained firm. A reinforcement now entered in close
column headed by General Leclerc, the commanding officer,
who said loudly, "In the name of General Bonaparte,
the Legislative Corps is dissolved; let all good citizens
retire. Grenadiers, forward!" The latter advanced,
leveling their muskets with fixed bayonets and occupying
the width of the hall. Most of the members at once
made their escape by the windows with undignified rapidity;
in a few minutes not one remained.</p>

<p>Lucien immediately assembled the "Moderate" members
of the Council who resumed its session, and in conjunction
with that of the Ancients, a decree was passed investing
the entire authority of the State in a Provisional Consulate
of three&mdash;Napoleon, Sieyes and Roger-Ducos who
were known as "Consuls of the French Republic." Thus
ended the 18th and 19th Brumaire, (November 10th and
11th, 1799) one of the most decisive revolutions of which
history has preserved any record; and, so admirable had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
been the arrangements of Napoleon, that it had not cost
France a drop of blood. "During the greater part of
this eventful day," says Bourrienne, "he was as calm as
at the opening of a great battle."</p>

<p>The next day the three Consuls met at Paris, and
France once more began to make progress. At this
meeting, Sieyes, who had up to this moment conceived
himself to be the head, and the others but the arms of the
new constitution, asked, as a form of politeness, "Which
of us is to preside?" "Do you not see," answered Ducos,
"that the general presides?"</p>

<p>Sieyes had expected that Napoleon would content himself
with the supreme command of all the armies, and had
no idea that he was conversant with, or wished to interfere
in profound and extensive political affairs and projects.
He was, however, so astonished at the knowledge displayed
by Napoleon in questions of administration, even to
the minutest details, and in every department, that when
their first conference was concluded, he hurried to Talleyrand,
Cabanis, and other counselors, assembled at St.
Cloud, exclaiming, "Gentlemen, you have now a master.
He knows everything, arranges everything, and can
accomplish everything."</p>

<p>Those persons must know the character of Napoleon
very imperfectly, who consider him great only at the head
of armies; for he was able to acquit himself of the various
functions of government with glory, shining equally as
conspicuous in the cabinet as in the field.</p>

<p>Napoleon guided and controlled everything; humane
laws were enacted; Christianity was again restored, and
upwards of 20,000 French citizens now came forth from
the prisons to bless his name. Many who had been exiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
because they did not approve of the Reign of Terror and
the despotism of the Directory were recalled, and many
other salutary reforms at once stamped the new government
with the seal of public approbation and the confidence
of Europe. In everything that was done the
genius of Napoleon was visible. A great man was
at the helm, and the world saw that his creative
genius was regenerating France. The new constitution
met the approval of the people, and in February 1800 the
First Consul took up his residence in the Tuileries, the
old home of the monarchs of France. Shortly afterwards
Napoleon reviewed the Army of Paris, amounting to
100,000 men. When the 96th, 43rd and 50th demi-brigades
defiled before him he was observed to take off
his hat and incline his head, in token of respect at
the sight of their colors torn to shreds with balls, and
blackened with smoke and powder.</p>

<p>For the first time in modern history the world saw
the greatest general of the age the civil chief of the most
brilliant state in Europe. The First Consul now held
frequent and splendid reviews of the troops. He traversed
the ranks, now on horseback, now on foot; entered into
the minutest details concerning the wants of the men and
the service, and dispensing in the name of the nation,
distinctions and rewards. A hundred soldiers who had
signalized themselves in action, received from his hand
the present of a handsome sabre each, on one of these
occasions.</p>

<p>The Parisians received the new constitution with delight.
The inhabitants also viewed the pomp and splendor of the
Consular government with surprise and self-complacency.
They reasoned little and hoped much. Napoleon was their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
idol, and from him alone they expected everything. The
constitution continued the executive power in the hands of
three consuls, who were to be elected for the space of ten
years, and were then eligible to re-election. The First Consul
held powers far superior to his colleagues. He alone had
the right of nominating all offices, civil and military, and
of appointing nearly all functionaries whatsoever. Napoleon
assumed the place of First Consul without question
or debate. He then named <ins title="originally 'Cambacéres'">Cambacérès</ins> and LeBrun as
Second and Third Consuls respectively.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Napoleon learned of the
death of Washington. He forthwith issued a general order
commanding the French army to wrap their banners in
crape during ten days in honor of "a great man who
fought against tyranny, and consolidated the liberties of
his country." He then celebrated a grand funeral service
to the memory of Washington in the council-hall of the
Invalides. The last standards taken in Egypt were presented
on the same occasion; all the ministers, the counselors
of state and generals, were present. The pillars
and roof were hung with the trophies of the campaign of
Italy and the bust of Washington was placed under the
trophy composed of the flags of Aboukir.</p>

<p>"From this day," says Lockhart, "a new epoch was
to date. Submit to that government, and no man need
fear that his former acts, far less opinions, should prove
any obstacle to his security&mdash;nay, to his advancement."
In truth the secret of Bonaparte's whole scheme is unfolded
in his own memorable words to Sieyes: "We are creating
a new era&mdash;of the past we must forget the bad, and
remember only the good."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>During the absence of Bonaparte in Egypt the tri-color
which he had left floating on the castles along the Rhine,
and from the Julian Alps to the Mediterranean, had been
humbled, and England and Austria, with the allies they
could bring into the coalition, were preparing once more
to compel the French to retire to their ancient boundaries,
and ultimately offer the crown to the exiled Bourbons.</p>

<p>But Napoleon knew that France needed internal repose,
and he desired universal peace in Europe. He even went so
far, in order to bring this about, as to address a letter to
George III. in which he said: "Your Majesty will
see in this overture only my sincere desire to contribute
effectually, for a second time, to a general pacification&mdash;by
a prompt step taken in confidence, and freed from those
forms, which, however necessary to disguise the feeble
apprehensions of feeble states, only serve to discover in
the powerful a mutual wish to deceive. France and England,
abusing their strength, may long defer the period
of its utter exhaustion; but I will venture to say that the
fate of civilized nations is concerned in the termination of
a war, the flames of which are raging throughout the
whole world. I have the honor, etc., etc., <span class="smcap">Bonaparte</span>."</p>

<p>If the king himself had had an opportunity to reply to
this letter, as he afterwards admitted, it would have saved
England millions of money, and Europe millions of lives;
but in a very short-sighted letter, Lord Grenville, then
Secretary of State, replied to Talleyrand, France's minister
of Foreign Affairs, in which he said: "The war must
continue until the causes which gave it birth cease to
exist. The restoration of the exiled royal family will be the
easiest means of giving confidence to the other powers of
Europe." The refusal of England to treat with the Con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>sular
Government of France was to be expected, being
perfectly in accord with the principles which guided the
rulers of England at that period. They had joined the
other governments of Europe in commencing war against
France, in order to restore its legitimate sovereign, contrary
to the will of the French people.</p>

<p>When Napoleon read the letter he said: "I will answer
that from Italy!" and immediately called his generals
together and ordered them to get ready for another campaign
beyond the Alps. It is said that on receiving the
reply from England Napoleon exclaimed to Talleyrand,
"It could not have been more favorable," but this is
credited by but few historians as it appears that his sincere
convictions were that peace was best for France.</p>

<p>Three days after the Grenville letter, the First Consul
electrified France by an edict for an army of reserve
embracing all the veterans then unemployed, who had ever
served the country, and a new levy of 30,000 recruits or
conscripts as they were termed; and the most active preparations
were rapidly made. At this time four great
armies were already in the field&mdash;one on the North coast
was watching Holland, and guarding against any invasion
from England; Jourdan commanded the Army of
the Danube, which had repassed the Rhine; Massena
was at the head of the Army of Helvetia, and held Switzerland;
and the fragment of the mighty host that Napoleon
had himself led to victory, still called the Army of
Italy.</p>

<p>Upwards of 350,000 men were now marched to various
points of conflict with the European powers&mdash;England,
Austria and Russia, together with Bavaria, Sweden, Denmark,
and Turkey, which made a formidable array of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
enemies with whom Napoleon had to contend. The operations
were conducted with the utmost secrecy. Napoleon
had decided to strike the decisive blow against Austria
in Italy, and to command there in person. An article in
the new constitution forbade the First Consul taking the
command of an army but he found a ready way to evade
it. Berthier was superseded by Carnot as minister of war
and given the nominal command of the Army of Italy.
It was generally believed that the troops were to advance
upon Italy. Meantime, while Austria was laughing
with derision at the French conscripts and "invalids" then
at Dijon and amused itself with caricatures of some ancient
men with wooden legs, and little boys twelve years old
entitled "Bonaparte's Army of Reserve," the real Army
of Italy was already formed in the heart of France and
was marching by various roads towards Switzerland and
was commanded by officers of recognized ability and
courage. The artillery was sent piecemeal from different
arsenals; the provisions, necessary to an army about to
cross barren mountains, were forwarded to Geneva,
embarked on the lake, and landed at Villeneuve, near the
entrance of the valley of the Simplon.</p>

<p>The daring plan of Napoleon was to transport his army
across the Alps; surmounting the highest chain of mountains
in Europe, by paths which are dangerous and difficult
to the unencumbered traveler; to plant himself in
the rear of the Austrians, interrupt their communications,
place them between his own army and that of Massena
who was in command of the 12,000 men at Genoa, cut
off their retreat and then give them battle under circumstances
which must necessarily render one defeat decisive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>After dispatching his orders Napoleon joined Berthier
at Geneva on May 8th, 1800. Here he met General
Marescot, the engineer, who by his orders had explored
the wild passes of the Alps. He described to the First
Consul most minutely the all but insuperable obstacles
that would oppose the passage of an army.</p>

</div>

<p>"Difficult, granted; but is it possible for an army to
pass?" Napoleon at last impatiently inquired.</p>

<p>"It might be done," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Then it shall be; let us start," said the First Consul,
and preparations for that most herculean task were at once
made, the commander intending to penetrate into Italy,
as Hannibal had done of old, through all the dangers and
difficulties of the great Alps themselves.</p>

<p>For the treble purpose of more easily collecting a
sufficient stock of provisions for the march, of making
its accomplishment more rapid, and on perplexing the
enemy on its termination, Napoleon determined that his
army should pass in four divisions, by as many separate
routes. The left wing, under Moncey consisting of 15,000
men, detached from the army of Moreau, was ordered to
debouch by the way of St. Gothard. The corps of
Thureau, 5,000 strong, took the direction of Mount
Cenis; that of Chabran, of similar strength, moved by
the Little St. Bernard. Of the main body, consisting of
35,000 men, although technically commanded by Berthier,
the First Consul himself took charge, including the gigantic
task of surmounting, with the artillery, the huge barriers
of the Great St. Bernard. Once across he expected to
rush down upon Melas, cut off all his communications
with Austria, and then force him to a conflict.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The main body of the army marched on the 15th of May
from Lausanne to the village of St. Pierre, at the foot of the
Great St. Bernard, at which point all traces of a practicable
path entirely ceased. Field forges were established at St.
Pierre to dismount the guns. The carriages and wheels
were slung on poles and the ammunition boxes were to be
carried by mules. To convey the pieces themselves a
number of trees were felled, hollowed out, or grooved,
and the guns being jammed within these rough cases, a
hundred soldiers were attached to each whose duty it was
to drag them up the steeps. All was now in readiness to
commence the great march.</p>

<p>"The First Consul set forth on his stupendous enterprise,"
says Botta in his description of this campaign,
"his forces being already at the foot of the Great St. Bernard.
The soldiers gazed on the aerial summits of the
lofty mountains with wonder and impatience. On the
17th of May the whole body set out from Martigny for
the conquest of Italy. Extraordinary was their order,
wonderful their gaiety, and astonishing also, the activity
and energy of their operations. Laughter and song lightened
their toils. They seemed to be hastening, not to a
fearful war, but a festival. The multitude of various
and mingled sounds were re-echoed from hill to hill, and
the silence of these solitary and desolate regions, which
revolving ages had left undisturbed, was for the moment
broken by the rejoicing voices of the gay and warlike.
Precipitous heights, strong torrents, sloping valleys,
succeeded each other with disheartening frequency.
Owing to his incredible boldness and order, Lannes was
chosen by the First Consul to take the lead in every
enterprise of danger. They had now reached an eleva<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>tion
where skill or courage seemed powerless against the
domain of Nature. From St. Pierre to the summit of
the Great St. Bernard there is no beaten road whatever,
until the explorer reaches the monastery of the religious
order devoted to the preservation of travelers bewildered
in these regions of eternal winter. Every means that
could be devised was adopted for transporting the artillery
and baggage; the carriages which had been wheeled
were now dragged&mdash;those which had been drawn were
now carried. The largest cannon were placed in troughs
and on sledges, and the smallest swung on sure-footed
mules. The ascent to be accomplished was immense. In
the windings of the tortuous paths the troops were now
lost and now revealed to sight. Those who first mounted
the steeps, seeing their companions in the depths below,
cheered them on with shouts of triumph. The valleys
on every side re-echoed to their voices. Amidst the snow,
in mists and clouds, the resplendent arms and colored uniforms
of the soldiers appeared in bright and dazzling contrast:
the sublimity of dead Nature and the energy of
living action thus united, formed a spectacle of surpassing
wonder.</p>

<p>"The Consul, exulting in the success of his plans, was seen
everywhere amongst the soldiers, talking with military
familiarity to one and now another, and, skilled in the eloquence
of camps, he so excited their courage that, braving
every obstacle, they now deemed that easy which
they had adjudged impossible. They soon approached
the highest summit, and discerned in the distance the pass
which leads from the opening between the towering mountains
to the loftiest pinnacle. With shouts of transport
they hailed this extreme point as the termination of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
labors and with new ardor prepared to ascend. When
their strength occasionally flagged under excess of
fatigues, they beat their drums, and then, reanimated by
the spirit-stirring sound, proceeded forward with fresh
vigor.</p>

<p>"At last they reached the summit and there felicitated
each other as if after a complete and assured victory.
Their hilarity was not a little increased by finding a simple
repast prepared in front of the monastery, the provident
Consul having furnished the monks with money to
supply what their own resources could not have afforded
for such numbers. Here they were regaled with wine
and bread and cheese, enjoyed a brief repose amid dismounted
cannon and scattered baggage, amidst ice and
conglomerated snow; while the monks passed from troop
to troop in turn, the calm of religious cheerfulness depicted
on their countenances. Thus did goodness and power
meet and hold communion on this extreme summit."</p>

<p>The troops made it a point of honor not to leave their
guns in the rear; and one division, rather than abandon
its artillery, chose to pass the night upon the summit of
a mountain, in the midst of snow and excessive cold.</p>

<p>Thus did this brave army reach the Hospice of St. Bernard,
singing amidst the precipices, dreaming of the conquest
of that Italy where they had so often tasted the
delights of victory, and having a noble presentiment of
the immortal glory which they were about to acquire;
as they climbed up and along airy ridges of rock and eternal
snow, where the goatherd, the hunter of the chamois,
and the outlaw smuggler, are alone accustomed to venture;
amidst precipices where to slip a foot is death;
beneath glaciers from which the percussion of a musket-shot
is often sufficient to hurl an avalanche.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>The labor was not so great for the infantry, of which there
were 35,000 including artillery. As for the 5,000 cavalry,
these walked, leading their horses by the bridle.
There was no danger in ascending but in the descent, the
path being very narrow, obliging them to walk before
the horse, they were liable, if the animal made a false
step, to be dragged by him into the abyss. Some accidents
of this kind, not many, did actually happen, and
some horses perished but scarcely any of the men.</p>

<p>After a brief rest at the hospice the army resumed its
march and descended to St. Remy without any unpleasant
accident. Napoleon rested and took a frugal repast at
the convent, after which he visited the chapel, and the
three little libraries, lingering a short time to read a few
pages of some old book. He performed the descent on a
sledge, down a glacier of nearly a hundred yards, almost
perpendicular. The whole army effected the passage of
the Great St. Bernard in the space of three days.</p>

<p>The transfer of the gun carriages, ammunition wagons
and cannon was the most difficult of all, but the genius of
Napoleon accomplished even this seemingly impossible feat.
The peasants of the environs were offered as high as a
thousand francs for every piece of cannon which they succeeded
in dragging from St. Pierre to St. Remy. It took
a hundred men to drag each; one day to get it up and
another to get it down.</p>

<p>It has been said that Napoleon had his fortune to make at
this period; but, at the moment of crossing Mount St. Bernard,
he had fought twenty pitched battles, conquered
Italy, dictated peace to Austria,&mdash;only sixty miles distant
from Vienna,&mdash;negotiated at Rastadt, with Count Cobentzel
for the surrender of the strong city of Mentz, raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
nearly three hundred millions in contributions,&mdash;which
had served to supply the army during two years,&mdash;created
the Cisalpine Army, and paid some of the officers of the
government at Paris. He had sent to the museum three
hundred <i>chef d'oéuvres</i>, in statuary and painting; added
to which he had conquered Egypt, suppressed the factions
at home and totally eradicated the war in La Vendée.</p>

<p>Napoleon has been pictured crossing the Alpine heights
mounted on a fiery steed. As a matter of fact he ascended
the Great St. Bernard in that gray surtout which he usually
wore, sometimes upon foot, and again upon a mule,
led by a guide belonging to the country, evincing even in
the difficult passes the abstraction of mind occupied elsewhere,
conversing with the officers scattered on the road,
and then, at intervals, questioning the guide who attended
him, making him relate the particulars of his life, his
pleasures, his pains, like an idle traveler who has nothing
better to do. "This guide," says Thiers, "who was
quite young, gave him a simple recital of the details of
his obscure existence, and especially the vexation he felt
because, for want of a little money, he could not marry
one of the girls of his valley. The First Consul, sometimes
listening, sometimes questioning the passengers with
whom the mountain was covered, arrived at the hospice,
where the worthy monks gave him a warm reception.
No sooner had he alighted from his mule than he wrote
a note which he handed to his guide, desiring him to be
sure and deliver it to the quartermaster of the army, who
had been left on the other side of the St. Bernard. In
the evening the young man, on returning to St. Pierre,
learned with surprise what powerful traveler it was whom
he had guided in the morning, and that General Bona<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>parte
had ordered that a house and a piece of ground
should be given to him immediately, and that he should be
supplied, in short, with the means requisite for marrying,
and for realizing all the dreams of his modest ambition."</p>

<p>This mountaineer lived for a number of years, and when
he died was still the owner of the land given him by the
First Consul. The only thing remembered by this attendant
in after years of the conversation of Napoleon
during his trip was, when shaking the rain-water from his
hat he exclaimed, "There! See what I have done in
your mountains&mdash;spoiled my new hat!&mdash;Well, I will find
another on the other side."</p>

<p>The passage of the Alps had been achieved long before
the Austrians knew Napoleon's army was in motion. So
utterly unexpected was this sudden apparition of the First
Consul and his army, that no precaution whatever had
been taken, and no enemy appeared capable of disputing
his march towards the valley of Aosta. After a brief
engagement at the fortress of St. Bard and other minor
battles in which the French were victorious, they now
advanced, unopposed down the valley to Ivrea which was
without a garrison. Here Napoleon remained four days
to recruit the strength of his troops.</p>

<p>Napoleon now took the road for Milan. The Sesia was
crossed without opposition; the passage of the Tesino
was effected after a sharp conflict with a body of Austrian
cavalry, who were put to flight; and, on the 2d of June,
the First Consul entered Milan, amidst enthusiastic
acclamations of the people, who had all believed that he
had died in Egypt and that it was one of his brothers who
commanded this army. He was conducted in triumph to
the ducal palace, where he took up his residence. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
remained six days in Milan during which time he gained
the most important information, all the dispatches between
the court of Vienna and General Melas falling into his
hands. From these he learned the extent of the Austrian
reinforcements now on their way to Italy; the position
and state of all the Austrian depots, field-equipages,
and parks of artillery; and the amount and distribution of
the whole Austrian force. Finally, he clearly perceived
that Melas still continued in complete ignorance of the
strength and destination of the French army. His dispatches
spoke with contempt of what he called "the pretended
army of reserve," and treated the assertion of
Napoleon's presence in Italy as a "mere fabrication."
Possessed of all this valuable information Napoleon
knew how to proceed with clearness and precision.</p>

<p>The eyes of the Austrian general were at length opened
and he was preparing to meet the emergency with all the
energy that the orders from Vienna and his great age of
eighty years permitted; but his delay had been sufficient
to render his situation critical. His army was divided into
two portions, one under Ott near Genoa; the other,
under his own command at Turin. The greatest risk
existed that Napoleon would, according to his old plan,
attack and destroy one division before the other could
form a junction with it. To prevent such a disaster, Ott
received orders to march forward on the Tesino, while
Melas, moving towards Alessandria, prepared to resume
his communications with the other division of his army.</p>

<p>Napoleon now advanced to Stradella where headquarters
were fixed. On the 9th of June, Lannes, who continued to
lead the van-guard of the French army was attacked by
an Austrian division superior in numbers and com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>manded
by Ott. The battle, though severely contested,
ended in the complete defeat of the Austrians, who lost
three thousand killed and six thousand prisoners. The
battle of Montebello was won by sheer hard fighting,
there being little opportunity for skill or manoeuvre, the
fields being covered with full-grown crops of rye. The
shower of balls from the Austrian musketry was at one
time so intense, that Lannes, speaking of it afterwards,
described its effect with a horrible graphic homeliness.
"Bones were cracking in my division" he said, "like a
shower of hail upon a skylight." Lannes was subsequently
created Duke of Montebello.</p>

<p>Napoleon remained stationary for three days at Stradella,
employing the time in concentrating his army, in
hopes that Melas would be compelled to give him battle
in this position; he was unwilling to descend into the
great plain of Marengo, where the Austrian cavalry and
artillery which was greatly superior in numbers, would
have a fearful advantage. Meanwhile he dispatched an
order to Suchet to march on the river Scrivia, and place
himself in the rear of the enemy.</p>

<p>General Desaix now joined the army with his aides-de-camp
Rapp and Savary, he having returned from
Egypt and landed in France almost on the very day that
Napoleon left Paris, and had immediately received a summons
from him to repair to the headquarters of the Army
of Italy, wherever they might be situated. Desaix and
Napoleon were warmly attached to each other and their
meeting was a great and mutual pleasure. Desaix was
appointed to the command of a division, the death of
General Boudet having left one vacant, and was extremely
anxious to signalize himself. Under the impression that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the Austrians were marching upon Genoa, Napoleon
dispatched Desaix's division in form of the van-guard
upon his extreme left, while Victor, arriving at Marengo
from Montebello, where he had assisted Lannes, routed a
rear guard of four or five thousand Austrians and made
himself master of the village of Marengo.</p>

<p>The French and Austrian armies finally came together
on June 14th on the plains of Marengo, to decide the fate
of Italy.</p>

<p>Marengo was a day ever to be remembered by those who
participated in the stubborn struggle. Napoleon fought
against terrible odds in numbers and position. A furious
cannonading opened the engagement at daybreak along
the whole front, cannon and musketry spreading devastation
everywhere&mdash;for the armies were but a short distance
apart, their pieces in some cases almost touching. The
advance under Gardanne, was obliged to fall back upon
Victor,&mdash;who had been stationed with the main body of the
first line,&mdash;for more than two hours and withstood singly
the vigorous assaults of a far superior force; Marengo
had been taken and retaken several times by Victor ere
Lannes, who was in the rear of him, in command of the
second line, received orders to reinforce him. The second
line was at length ordered by Napoleon to advance,
but they found the first in retreat, and the two corps took
up a second line of defense, considerably to the rear of
Marengo. Here they were again charged furiously, and
again after obstinate resistance, gave way. The retreat
now became general, although Lannes fell back in perfect
order.</p>

<p>The Austrians had fought the battle admirably. Their
infantry had opened an attack on every point of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
French line, while the cavalry debouched across the bridge
which the French had failed to destroy, and assailed the
right of their army with such fury and rapidity that it
was thrown into complete disorder. The attack of the
Austrians was successful everywhere; the centre of the
French was penetrated, the left routed, and another desperate
charge of the cavalry would have terminated the
battle. The order for this, however, was not given; but
the retreating French were still in the utmost peril. Napoleon
had been collecting reserves between Garafolo and
Marengo and now sent orders for his army to retreat
towards these reserves, and rally round his guard which
he stationed in the rear of the village of Marengo and
placed himself at their head.</p>

<p>To secure a position more favorable for resisting the
overpowering numbers of the enemy, Bonaparte now
seized a defile flanked by the village of Marengo, shut up
on one side by a wood and on the other by lofty and
bushy vineyards. Here from the astonishing exertions
of their commander the French made a firm stand, and
fought bayonet to bayonet with Austrian infantry, whilst
exposed at the same time to a battery of thirty pieces of
cannon, which was playing upon them with deadly
effect. Every soldier seemed to consider this the defile of
Thermopylae, where they were to fight until all were
slain. With a heroism worthy of the Spartan band they
withstood the tremendous shock of bayonets and artillery,
the latter not only cutting the men in pieces, but
likewise the trees, the large branches in falling killing
many of the wounded soldiers who had sought a refuge
under them. At this awful moment Bonaparte, unmoved,
seemed to court death, and be near it, the bullets being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
observed repeatedly to tear up the ground beneath his
horse's feet. Alarmed for his safety the officers exhorted
him to retire, exclaiming, "If you should be killed all
would be lost." But the hero of Lodi and Arcola would not
retire. Undismayed and unmoved amidst this dreadful
tempest, he observed every movement and gave orders
with the utmost coolness. The soldiers could all see the
First Consul with his staff, surrounded by the two hundred
grenadiers of the guard and the sight kept their hopes
from flagging. The right wing, under Lannes, quickly
rallied; the centre, reinforced by the scattered troops of the
left, recovered its strength; the left wing no longer
existed; its scattered remains fled in disorder, pursued by
the Austrians. The contest continued to rage, and was
obstinately disputed; but the main body of the French
army, which still remained in order of battle, was continually,
though very slowly, retreating.</p>

<p>The First Consul now dispatched his aide-de-camp,
Bruyere, to Desaix, with an urgent message to hasten to
the field of battle. Desaix on his part, had been arrested
in his march upon Novi, by the repeated discharges of
distant artillery; he had in consequence made a halt,
and dispatched Savary, then his aide-de-camp, with a
body of fifty horse, to gallop with all possible haste to
Novi, ascertain the state of affairs there, according to the
orders of Napoleon, while he kept his division fresh and
ready for action.</p>

<p>Savary found all quiet at Novi; and returning to
Desaix, after the lapse of about two hours, with this
intelligence, was next sent to the First Consul. He
spurred his horse across the country, in the direction of
Marengo, and fortunately met General Bruyere, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
taking the same short cut to find Desaix. Giving him
the necessary directions, Savary now hastened towards
Napoleon. He found him in the midst of his guard, who
stood their ground on the field of battle; forming a solid
body in the face of the enemy's fire, the dismounted
grenadiers were stationed in front and the place of each
man who fell was instantly supplied from the ranks
behind.</p>

<p>Maps were spread out before Napoleon; he was planning
the movement which was to decide the action. Savary
made his report and told him of Desaix's position.</p>

<p>"At what hour did he leave you?" said the First
Consul pulling out his watch. Having been informed he
continued, "Well he cannot be far off; go, and tell him
to form in that direction (pointing with his hand to a
particular spot); let him quit the main road, and make
way for all those wounded men, who would only embarrass
him, and perhaps draw his own soldiers after them."</p>

<p>It was now three o'clock in the afternoon; had Melas
pursued the advantage with all his reserve the battle was
won to the Austrians; but that aged general (he was eighty
years old) doubted not that he had won it already. At
this critical moment, being quite worn out with fatigue,
he retired to the rear leaving General Zach to continue
what he now considered a mere pursuit.</p>

<p>Napoleon's army was still slowly retiring from the
field, one corps occupying three hours in retiring three
quarters of a league, when Desaix, whose division was now
forming on the left of the centre, rode up to the commander,
and taking out his watch, said in reply to a question:
"Yes, the battle is lost; but it is only three o'clock;
there is time enough to gain another!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Bonaparte was delighted with the opinion of Desaix,
whose division had arrived at a full gallop after a force
march of thirty miles, and prepared to avail himself of
the timely succor brought to him by that far-seeing general,
and of the advantage insured to him by the position
he had lately taken. Napoleon quickly explained the
manoeuvre he was about to effect and gave the orders
instantly. He now drew up his army on a third line of
battle, and riding along said to the different corps: "Soldiers!
We have fallen back far enough. You know it is
always my custom to sleep on the field of battle." The
whole army now wheeled its front up the left wing of its
centre, moving its right wing forward at the same time.
By this movement Napoleon effected the double object of
turning all the enemy's troops, who had continued the
pursuit of the broken left wing and of removing his right
at a distance from the bridge, which had been so fatal to
him in the morning. The artillery of the guard was reinforced
by that which belonged to Desaix's division, and
formed an overwhelming battery in the centre.</p>

<p>The Austrians made no effort to prevent this decisive
movement; they supposed the First Consul was only occupied
in securing his retreat. Their infantry, in deep
close columns, was advancing rapidly, when at the distance
of a hundred paces they suddenly halted, on perceiving
Desaix's division exactly in front of them. The unexpected
appearance of six thousand fresh troops, and the
new position assumed by the French, arrested the battle:
very few shots were heard; the two armies were preparing
for a last effort.</p>

<p>The First Consul rode up in person to give the order of
attack while he dispatched Savary with commands to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Kellerman, who was at the head of about six thousand
heavy cavalry, to charge the Austrian column in flank,
at the same time Desaix charged it in front. Both generals
effected the movement rapidly and so successfully that
in less than half an hour the French had put the enemy to
rout on nearly all sides. A final charge was now made,
when Desaix, whose timely arrival with reinforcements
had saved the day, and who was then in the thickest of
the engagement, was shot dead, just as he led a fresh column
of 5,000 grenadiers to meet and check the advance of
Zach. But a few moments before Desaix said to Savary,
"Go and tell the First Consul that I am charging, and
that I am in want of cavalry to support me." As the
brave man fell he said: "Conceal my death, it might
dishearten the troops." Napoleon embraced him for an
instant, and said, as his eyes filled with tears: "Alas, I
must not weep now&mdash;" and mounting his horse again
plunged into the thickest of the battle.</p>

<p>The whole army fought with renewed vigor on learning
of Desaix's death, every soldier being bent on avenging
individually the loss of their leader. The combined
forces now concentrated themselves and hurled their invincible
columns upon the Austrian lines, marching victorious
at last over thousands of slain. General Zach, and all
his staff, were here made prisoners. The Austrian columns
behind, being flushed with victory, were advancing
too carelessly, and were unable to resist the general
assault of the whole French line, which now pressed
onward under the immediate command of Napoleon.
Post after post was carried. The terrified cavalry and
broken infantry fled in confusion to the banks of the Bormida,
into which they were plunged by the French cav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>alry
who swept the field. The Bormida was clogged and
crimsoned with corpses, and whole corps, being unable to
effect the passage, surrendered. The victory, which had
seemed quite secure to the Austrians at 3 o'clock was completely
won by the French at six. Napoleon's conduct
throughout the day and the bravery of his troops were
beyond all praise; and it is no less a fact, that the appearance
of victory in one or two parts of the extended field
roused the courage of the Austrians to enthusiasm and in
some cases fatal recklessness. They pressed forward to
complete their triumph when the Consular guard, called
the "wall of granite," met and successfully resisted the
shock. The eye of Napoleon fixed the fortune of the day:
he foresaw that the enemy, in the ardor of success, would
extend his line too far; and what he had conjectured happened.
Then it was that Desaix's division rushed amidst
the all but triumphant foe, divided his ranks, and finally
completed his ruin.</p>

<p>In this sanguine engagement the Austrians lost about
8,000 men in killed and wounded, and 4,000 more were
taken prisoners&mdash;one-third of their army. The life of
Desaix was the sacrifice. The French loss amounted to
6,000 killed or wounded and about 1,000 of them were
taken prisoners, a loss of about one-fourth out of 28,000
soldiers present at the battle.</p>

<p>In the estimation of the First Consul this loss was great
enough to diminish the joy that he felt for the victory.
When Bourrienne, his secretary, congratulated him on
his triumph saying, "What a glorious day!" he replied:
"Yes it would have been glorious indeed, could I but
have embraced Desaix this evening on the field of battle.
I was going to make him minister of war; I would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
made him a prince if I could." The triumph of this
decisive victory was poisoned by Desaix's death. It
seems that he never loved, nor regretted, any man so
much and he never spoke of him without deep feeling.
Desaix met his death at the early age of thirty-three,
and France lost in him a great general and a man of rare
promise. Savary, who was much attached to him, sought
for his body amongst the dead, and found him completely
stripped of his clothes, lying among many others in the
same condition. "France has lost one of her most
able defenders and I my best friend," Napoleon said after
the battle; "No one has ever known how much goodness
there was in Desaix's heart; how much genius in
his head." Then after a short silence, with tears starting
into his eyes, he added, "My brave Desaix always
wished to die thus; but death should not have been so
ready to execute his wish."</p>

<p>Though the vast plain of Marengo was drenched with
French blood, joy pervaded the army. Soldiers and
generals alike were merited for their gallant conduct and
were fully aware of the importance of the victory to
France. Thus ended the battle of Marengo, one of the
most decisive which had been fought in Europe, and one
which opened to Napoleon the gates of all the principal
cities of northern Italy. By one battle he regained nearly
all that the French had lost in the unhappy Italian campaign
of 1799 while he was in Egypt. He had
also shown that the French troops were once more what
they had been when he was in the field to command them.</p>

<p>In talking with Gohier one day, Napoleon said: "It is
always the greater number which defeats the lesser."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"And yet," said Gohier, "with small armies you have
frequently defeated large ones." "Even then," replied
Napoleon, "it is always the inferior force which was
defeated by the superior. When with a small body of
men I was in the presence of a large one, collecting my
little band, I fell like lightning on one of the wings of the
hostile army, and defeated it. Profiting by the disorder
which such an event never failed to occasion in their
whole line, I repeated the attack, with similar success, in
another quarter, still with my whole force. I thus beat
it in detail. The general victory which was the result
was still an example of the truth of the principle, that
the greater force defeats the lesser." One of his favorite
maxims is said to have been, "God always favors the
heaviest battalions."</p>

<p>The Austrians were completely enveloped, and had no
alternative but to submit to the law of the conqueror.
Melas sent a flag of truce to Napoleon at daybreak on the
following morning, and peace negotiations were at once
began. In the meeting which followed Bonaparte
required that all the fortresses of Liguria, Piedmont, Lombardy
and the Legations should be immediately given up
to France, and that the Austrians should evacuate all
Italy as far as the Mincio.</p>

<p>The surrender of Genoa was strongly objected to by
Melas, but the conqueror would not waive this
point. The baron sent his principal negotiator to make
some remonstrances against the proposed armistice:
"Sir," said the First Consul with some warmth, "my
conditions are irrevocable. It was not yesterday that I
began my military life; your position is as well known
to me as to yourselves. You are in Alessandria, encum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>bered
with dead, wounded, sick, destitute of provisions;
you have lost the best troops of your army, and are surrounded
on all sides. There is nothing that I might not
require, but I respect the gray hair of your general,
and the valor of your troops, and I require, nothing
more than is imperatively demanded by the present
situation of affairs. Return to Alessandria; do what
you will, you shall have no other conditions."</p>

<p>The treaty of peace was signed at Alessandria, the
same day, June 15th, 1800, as originally proposed by
General Bonaparte. He then started for Paris by way of
Milan, where preparations had been made for a solemn
Te Deum in the ancient cathedral, and at which the First
Consul was present. He found the city illuminated, and
ringing with the most enthusiastic rejoicings. The
streets were lined with people who greeted him with
shouts of welcome. Draperies were hung from the windows,
which were crowded by women of the first rank
and who threw flowers into his carriage as he passed.
He set off for Paris on the 24th of June and arrived at
the French capital in the night between the 2nd and 3rd
of July, having been absent less than two months. Massena
remained as Commander-in-chief of the Army of
Italy.</p>

<p>To one of his traveling companions with whom he conversed
on the journey to Paris about his remarkable victory
at Marengo, he said: "Well, a few grand deeds
like this campaign and I may be known to posterity."
"It seems to me," said his companion, "that you have
already done enough to be talked about everywhere for a
time." "Done enough," said Bonaparte quickly, "You
are very kind! To be sure in less than two years I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
conquered Cairo, Paris and Milan; well, my dear fellow,
if I were to die to-morrow, after ten centuries I shouldn't
fill half a page in a universal history!"</p>

<p>At night the city of Paris was brilliantly illuminated
and the inhabitants turned out en masse. Night after
night every house was illuminated. The people were so
anxious to show their pleasure at Napoleon's miraculous
victory that they stood in crowds around the palace contented
if they could but catch a glimpse of the preserver
of France. These receptions so deeply touched him that
twenty years afterwards, in loneliness and in exile, a prisoner
at St. Helena, he mentioned it as one of the proudest and
happiest moments of his life.</p>

<p>On the day following his return to the capital the president
of the Senate&mdash;the entire body having waited upon
him in state&mdash;complimented the conqueror of Marengo in
language such as kings were formerly addressed in,
and in closing his address said: "We take pleasure
in acknowledging that to you the country owes its salvation;
that to you the Republic will owe its consolidation,
and the people a prosperity, which you have in one
day made to succeed ten years of the most stormy of
revolutions."</p>

<p>In November following Napoleon's return to the capital
he received a letter addressed to him by Count de Lille
(afterwards Louis XVIII.) which the exiled prince of the
House of Bourbon evidently believed would place him on
the throne of France. He said: "You are very tardy
about restoring my throne to me; it is to be feared that
you may let the favorable moment slip. You cannot
establish the happiness of France without me; and I, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the other hand, can do nothing for France without you.
Make haste, then, and point out, yourself, the posts and
dignities which will satisfy you and your friends."</p>

<p>The First Consul answered thus: "I have received
your Royal Highness' letter. I have always taken a lively
interest in your misfortunes and those of your family.
You must not think of appearing in France&mdash;<i>you could not
do so without marching over five hundred thousand corpses</i>.
For the rest, I shall always be zealous to do whatever lies
in my power towards softening your Royal Highness'
destinies, and making you forget, if possible, your misfortunes.
<span class="smcap">Bonaparte.</span>"</p>

<p>The battle of Marengo was celebrated at Paris by a fête
on the 14th of July, which presented a singularly interesting
spectacle owing to the appearance of the "wall of
granite," the members of which, just as the games were
about to begin, marched into the field. The sight of those
soldiers, covered with the dust of their march, sun-burned
and powder-stained, and bearing marks of heroic deeds
on the battlefield, formed a scene so truly affecting that
the populace could not be restrained by the guards from
violating the limits, in order to take a nearer view of those
interesting heroes.</p>

ULM AND AUSTERLITZ</h2>

<p class="p2">Napoleon had now reached such a point of power that
the Bourbons resigned all hopes of restoration through his
agency, and as the next best means of obtaining control
of the throne of France assassination was decided upon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
The First Consul had scarcely been in Paris a month, after
the engagement at Marengo when Ceracchi, a sculptor of
some fame, attempted Bonaparte's life as he was
entering the theatre. But for his betrayal by a co-conspirator
the plot would have succeeded. This attempt by
means of the dagger was followed by the explosion of an
infernal machine, which consisted of a barrel of gunpowder
surrounded by an immense quantity of grape shot.
On the night of October 10th the machine was placed at
Nacaise, a narrow street through which Napoleon was to
pass on his way to the opera house.</p>

<p>Some years later, in telling of the narrow escape he had
on that night, he said: "I had been hard at work all
day, and was so overpowered by sleep after dinner that
Josephine, who was quite anxious to go to the opera that
night, found it quite difficult to arouse me and persuade
me to go. I fell asleep again after we had entered
the carriage, and I was dreaming of the danger I had
undergone some years before in crossing the Tagliamento
at midnight by the light of torches, during a flood, when
I was waked by the explosion of the infernal machine.
'We are blown up,' I said to Bessieres and Lannes, who
were in the carriage, and then quickly commanded the
coachman to drive on."</p>

<p>The coachman, who was intoxicated, heard the order,
and having mistaken the explosion for a salute, lashed
his horses furiously until the theatre was reached. The
machine had been fired by a slow match, and the explosion
took place just twenty seconds too soon. Summary
justice was executed upon the perpetrators of this infamous
deed, and some time later the Duke d' Enghien
atoned for the part, whatever it might have been, that the
Bourbons had taken in these murderous schemes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Austria delayed for several months final negotiations of
the treaty agreed upon after the engagement at Marengo,
evidently reassured by the attempts made on the First
Consul's life. Preliminaries of peace had been signed at
Paris, between the Austrian general, Saint Julian, and the
French government. Duroc was dispatched to the Emperor
of Austria, to obtain his ratification of the articles; but
having reached the headquarters of the Army of the Rhine,
he was refused a pass to proceed on his journey.</p>

<p>Napoleon immediately ordered Moreau to recommence
hostilities, unless the Emperor delivered up the fortresses
of Ulm, Ingolstadt and Phillipsburg as pledges of his
sincerity. Austria, accordingly, purchased a further protraction
of the armistice at this heavy price; at the same
time offering to treat for peace on new grounds. News of
the occupation of the three fortresses by the French troops,
was announced in Paris on the 23d of September 1800,
where the fresh hopes of peace caused universal satisfaction.</p>

<p>These hopes, however, proved delusive. Austria delayed
and equivocated, until it became evident the Emperor
would make no peace separate from England, and that
the latter power was prepared to support her ally.</p>

<p>Napoleon, perceiving that he was being trifled with,
now gave orders (in November, 1800) to all his generals
to put their divisions in march all along the frontiers of
the French dominions. The shock was instantaneous,
from the Rhine to the Mincio. Brune overwhelmed the
Austrians on the Mincio; Macdonald held the Tyrol, and
Moreau achieved the glorious victory of Hohenlinden
after a desperate and most sanguinary battle. This latter
contest decided the fate of the campaign. Thus with
three victorious armies, either of which could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
marched triumphantly into Vienna, Napoleon hesitated
long enough before taking that final step, to allow Austria
to sign an honest and definite peace. The treaty of
Luneville was at last signed in good faith on February 9th,
1801. By the peace of Luneville, Napoleon for the second
time effected the pacification of the Continent. Of all the
powerful coalition which threatened France in 1800,
England alone continued hostile in 1801 if we except
Turkey, with which no arrangement could be made until
the affairs of Egypt were settled.</p>

<p>On the 8th of March, 1801, a British army of 17,000 men
landed in Egypt under the command of Sir Ralph Abercromby.
The French were very ill-prepared for an
attack. The English army overcame the resistance of the
forces which opposed their landing through the heavy surf
formed on the beach, and advanced upon their enemy. No
general action occurred until the 21st when the English
obtained a decisive victory and drove Menou,&mdash;who had
succeeded to the command of the troops in Egypt at the
death of Kléber,&mdash;with great loss within the walls of
Alexandria. Here he was blockaded and General Belliard,
cut off from all communication with him, capitulated after
which Menou submitted. Each capitulated on condition
of being taken back to France with all his troops and their
arms and baggage. Thus ended the conquest of Egypt by
Napoleon. The French admiral, Gantheaume, had long
been making fruitless efforts to land reinforcements in
Egypt, but had been unable to elude the British ships.
He was now ordered to return to Toulon, where preparations
were made to receive the French troops.</p>

<p>After the news of the reverses of the French army in
Egypt, and the great sea victory of Copenhagen by Nelson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Napoleon was determined to bring England to negotiations
of peace and a recognition of the French Republic, and with
this in view he gathered an army of 100,000 men on the
coasts of France, with a flotilla sufficiently large to effect a
landing in England, whenever circumstances seemed to
favor such a movement. At this very moment it was, that
Fulton, the inventor of steam-boats, communicated his
discovery to the First Consul. Napoleon thus had the
first chance placed in his hands of possessing exclusively
for a time, the greatest and most diversified means of physical
power ever known in the world. Scarcely deigning
to bestow a thought upon the subject the First Consul
treated the inventor as a "visionary."</p>

<p>Whether or not Napoleon ever intended to invade Great
Britain, he succeeded at all events in convincing the world
for a time that such was his design, and when the peace of
Amiens was signed on March 25th, 1802, Paris and London
rejoiced, as did all civilized nations. The peace of Amiens
left the military resources of France unemployed on the
hands of Bonaparte. This induced him to think of profiting
by the European calm, and effect the conquest of St.
Domingo. He gave the command of the expedition to his
brother-in-law, Leclerc; but it was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The inauguration of Christian worship once more in
France in 1802 gave Napoleon an opportunity to show
that he had the interest of the people at heart. France
was an infidel nation, and it was the fashion to believe
there was no God. The signing of the Concordat by
Pope Pius VII. gave to France what she had long needed&mdash;a
form of religious worship. It required no little strength
of purpose to take this step. "Religion is a principle
which cannot be eradicated from the heart of man;" said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Napoleon. "Last Sunday I was walking here alone, and
the church bells of the village of Ruel rang at sunset. I
was strongly moved, so vividly did the memory of early
days come back with that sound. If it be thus with me,
what must it be with others? In re-establishing the
Church, I consult the wishes of the great majority of my
people." A grand religious ceremony took place at Notre
Dame Cathedral to celebrate the proclamation of the Concordat,
at which the First Consul presided with great
pomp, attended by all the ministers and general officers
then in Paris. Another measure, adopted at this period,
was the decree permitting the return of the emigrants,
provided they appeared and took the oath to the government
within a certain period. It is estimated that a
hundred thousand exiles returned to their country in
consequence of this decree.</p>

<p>It was about this period, too, that the First Consul
turned his attention to the system of a national education.
He also commenced the herculean task of preparing a
code of law for the French nation with the result that the
"Code Napoleon" is known to every civilized nation of
the earth. Public improvements, formerly projected,
were now carried out, and sciences and the arts progressed
as never before.</p>

<p>The order of the Legion of Honor owes its inception to
Napoleon Bonaparte, and it was he who placed it on such
a footing in France that it has since thrived there as has
no similar institution on the Continent. When established
by him, after months of careful consideration, he believed
it necessary to France. To his Counselors of State he
said: "They talk about ribbons and crosses being the
playthings of monarchs, and say that the old Romans had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
no system of honorary rewards. The Romans had patricians,
knights, citizens and slaves,&mdash;for each class different
dresses and different manners&mdash;mural crowns, civic
crowns, orations, triumphs and titles. When the noble
band of patricians lost its influence, Rome fell to pieces&mdash;the
people were a vile rabble. It was then that you saw
the fury of Marius, the proscriptions of Scylla, and afterward
of the Emperors. In that manner Brutus is talked
of as the enemy of tyrants; he was an aristocrat, who
stabbed Caesar because Caesar wished to lower the authority
of the senate. You call these ribbons and crosses
child's rattles&mdash;be it so: It is with such rattles that men
are led. I would not say that to the multitude, but in a
council of wise men and statesmen one may speak the
truth.... Observe how the people bow before the
decorations of foreigners. Voltaire calls the common soldiers
'Alexanders at five sous a day.' He was right. It
is just so. Do you imagine you can make men fight by
reasoning? Never! You must bribe them with glory,
with distinctions and rewards.... In fine, it is agreed
that we have need of some kind of institutions. If this
Legion of Honor is not approved, let some other be suggested.
I do not pretend that it alone will save the State,
but it will do its part."</p>

<p>The Legion of Honor was instituted on the 15th of May
1802. When Napoleon had seen the fruits of it, he said:
"This order was the reward of every one who was an
honor to his country, stood at the head of his profession,
and contributed to the national prosperity and glory.
Some were dissatisfied because the decoration was conferred
alike on officers and soldiers; others, because it was
given for civil and military merits indiscriminately; but if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
this order ever cease to be the recompense of the brave
private, or be confined to military men alone, it will cease
to be what I made it,&mdash;the Legion of Honor."</p>

<p>The First Consul was, in right of his office, captain general
of the legion and president of the council of administration.
The nomination of all the members was for life. The
grand officers were endowed with a yearly pension of
upwards of $1000. Pensions, decreasing in amount, were
also affixed to the subordinate degrees of rank in the order.
All the members were required to swear, upon their honor,
to defend the government of France, and maintain the
inviolability of her Empire, to combat, by every lawful
means against the re-establishment of feudal institutions,
and to concur in maintaining the principle of liberty and
equality. On the day the order was instituted, Napoleon,
by act of the Senate was appointed Consul for life. The
First Consul accepted the offered prolongation from the
Senate, on the condition that the opinion of the people
should be consulted on the subject. The question put to
them, as framed by <ins title="originally 'Cambacérés'">Cambacérès</ins> and Le Brun, was:
"Napoleon Bonaparte&mdash;Shall he be Consul for life?" Registers
were opened in all municipalities; and the answer of
the people qualified to vote was decisive. Upwards of
three million five hundred thousand voted for the proposal;
8,300 against it. In the month of August Napoleon was
formally declared Consul for life and a decree of the
Senate immediately consolidated his power, by permitting
him to appoint his successor.</p>

<p>This personal elevation had its ample share in contributing
to the number of Napoleon's enemies. In fact it
appears in some measure astonishing how any individual
could persuade a whole nation, day after day, to yield him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
up such a portion of its rights and privileges. However,
among many instances that might be adduced of his powers
of persuasion, one which occurred about this period is
not the least remarkable. In the beginning of the summer
of 1802 some officers of rank, enthusiastic republicans,
took umbrage at Napoleon's conduct, and determined
to go and remonstrate with him upon the points that had
given them offense, and speak their minds freely. On the
evening of the same day, one of the party gave the following
account of the interview: "I do not know whence it arises,
but there is a charm about that man, indescribable and irresistible.
I am no admirer of his; I dislike the power to which
he has risen; yet I cannot help confessing that there is
something in him which seems to speak him born to command.
We went into his apartment, determined to declare
our minds; to expostulate with him warmly; and not to
depart till our subject of complaint should be removed.
But in his manner of receiving us there was a certain tact
which disarmed us in a moment; nor could we utter one
word of what we had intended to say. He talked to us
for a length of time, with an eloquence peculiarly his own,
explaining with the utmost clearness and precision, the
necessity of steadily pursuing the line of conduct he had
adopted, and, without contradicting us in direct terms,
controverted our opinions so ably, that we had not a word
to offer in reply, we therefore retired, having done nothing
but listen to, instead of expostulating with him, fully
convinced, at least for the moment, that he was right, and
that we were altogether in the wrong!"</p>

<p>Towards the close of the year 1802 it became evident
that the peace of Amiens was based on a hollow foundation,
and was destined at no distant period to be overthrown. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
an interview held with Lord Whitworth, an ambassador
from England, Napoleon said: "No consideration on
earth shall make me consent to your retention of Malta; I
would as soon agree to put you in possession of the Faubourg
St. Antoine. Every wind that blows from England
brings nothing but hatred and hostility towards me. An
invasion is the only means of offense that I can take
against her, and I am determined to put myself at the
head of the expedition. There are a hundred chances to
one against my success; but I am not the less determined
to attempt the descent, if war must be the consequence
of the present discussion." He now quickly brought
matters to a crisis. He attacked the ambassador in vigorous
language at a diplomatic meeting at the Tuileries
which ended in an abrupt termination of the conference
by Napoleon leaving the room.</p>

<p>The armistice lasted until March 18th, 1803, when
England again declared war upon France. All commerce
of the French nation was ordered seized, wherever found,
and two hundred vessels, containing at least $15,000,000
worth of property fell into the hands of England. Napoleon
retaliated by arresting upwards of ten thousand Englishmen
then in France. The tocsin of war was sounded
in every part of Europe, and 160,000 French soldiers
were marshaled on the coasts of France, again threatening
an invasion of England. France at this time was
totally unprepared for war; a proof sufficient to show
that the First Consul had not desired the termination of
peace. The army was completely on a peace establishment;
great numbers of the troops were disbanded
and the parks of artillery were broken up. New plans
for re-casting the artillery had been proposed, and they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
already begun to break up the cannon to throw them into
the furnaces. The navy was in a still less serviceable
condition. In an address to the Senate Napoleon said:
"The negotiations are ended and we are attacked; let us
at least fight to maintain the faith of treaties and the
honor of the French name." The nation responded with
enthusiasm to the call; sums of money were voted by
the large towns for building ships and the army was rapidly
recruited.</p>

<p>The first hostile movement of Napoleon was upon the
continental domains of George III. General Mortier
invaded the Electorate of Hanover with 15,000 men and
the Hanoverian army laid down its arms. The second
movement of the First Consul was the occupation of
Naples. No resistance was attempted. These measures,
besides enabling Napoleon to maintain his army by levies
on the foreign states he occupied, also crippled the commerce
of England by shutting up all communication
with many of the best markets on the Continent. The First
Consul now visited the principal towns, accompanied by
Josephine, where he made observations and gave orders
respecting the fortifications. These measures were all
preparatory on the part of Napoleon to his determined
plan to attempt the invasion of England. Funds were
secured in part by the sale of Louisiana to the United
States.</p>

<p>Assassination was now again resorted to that Napoleon
might be overthrown; but every attempt, as heretofore,
proved futile. Conspiracy after conspiracy was detected&mdash;all
traced to Napoleon's political enemies. The First
Consul resolved on retaliation and ordered the arrest of
the Duke d'Enghien at his castle in the Duchy of Baden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Three days afterwards the duke was conveyed to Paris,
and after a few hours' imprisonment, was taken to the old
State Prison of France, where he was tried by court
martial, and in a most summary and hasty manner pronounced
guilty of having fought against the Republic and
condemned to death. He was led down a winding stairway
by torchlight, and shot in a ditch in the castle at six o'clock
in the morning. All Europe shuddered at the deed, but
it produced exactly the result Napoleon intended by it;
he was safe from attempts on his life forever afterwards.</p>

<p>Before the discovery of this plot the French Senate had
sent an address to Napoleon congratulating him on his
escape from a former conspiracy in which one hundred
persons had schemed to take his life. In answer he said:
"I have long since renounced the hope of enjoying the
pleasures of a private life; all my days are employed in fulfilling
the duties which my fate and the will of the French
people have imposed upon me. Heaven will watch over
France, and defeat the plots of the wicked. The citizens
may be without alarm; my life will last as long as it will
be useful to the nation; but I wish the French people to
understand that existence, without their confidence and
affection, would be to me without consolation, and would
for them have no object."</p>

<p>The title of First Consul, by which Napoleon had been
distinguished for more than four years, was exchanged
on the 18th of May 1804 for that of Emperor by the
advice of the Senate, where it was first publicly broached,
and by the universal assent of the French nation. Upwards
of 3,500,000 voted for the measure and about
2,000 against it. The debates in the Senate were
somewhat protracted and so great was the impatience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of the military that the garrison of Paris had resolved to
proclaim their chief as Emperor, at the first review; and
Murat, governor of the city, was obliged to assemble the
officers at his house, and bind them by a promise to
restrain the troops. The spirit of the army at Boulogne
was soon manifested, by their voting the erection of a colossal
statue of Napoleon, in bronze, to be placed in the
midst of the camp. Every soldier subscribed a portion of
his pay for the purpose; but there was a want of bronze.
Soult, who presided over the completion of the undertaking,
went, at the head of a deputation to Napoleon, and
said: "Sire, lend me the bronze, and I will repay it in
enemy's cannon at the first battle," and he kept his word.</p>

</div>

<p>On the 27th of May Napoleon received the oath of the
Senate, the constituted bodies, the learned corporations
and the troops of the garrison of Paris. Louis XVIII.
immediately addressed a protest to all the sovereigns
of Europe against the usurpation of Napoleon. Fouché,
who was the first who heard of this document, immediately
communicated the intelligence to the Emperor,
with a view to prepare the necessary orders to watch
over those who might attempt its circulation; but great
was his surprise, on receiving directions to have the
whole inserted in "The Moniteur" the following morning,
where it actually appeared. This was all the notice
taken of the matter by Napoleon.</p>

<p>On December 1st of the same year, the lists of votes
in favor of the establishment of the hereditary succession
of the Empire in his family were publicly presented by
the Senate to Napoleon, and on the following day, in the
midst of one of the most imposing and brilliant scenes
ever enacted in France, Napoleon and Josephine were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
crowned Emperor and Empress of France by Pius VII.,
the Pontiff of Rome, in the Cathedral of Notre Dame.</p>

<p>The Emperor took his coronation oath as usual on such
occasions, with his hand upon the Scripture, and in the
form repeated to him by the Pope; but in the act of coronation
itself there was a marked deviation from the universal
custom. The crown having been blessed by the
Pope, Napoleon took it from the altar with his own hands
and placed it on his brow. He then put the diadem on
the head of Josephine. The heralds proclaimed that "the
thrice glorious and thrice august Napoleon, Emperor of
the French, was crowned and installed;" and so ended
the pageant. "Those who remember having beheld it,"
says Sir Walter Scott, "must now doubt whether they
were waking, or whether fancy had formed a vision so dazzling
in its appearance, so extraordinary in its origin and
progress, and so ephemeral in its endurance."</p>

<p>The senators of the Italian Republic soon afterwards
requested that Napoleon be crowned as their king, and
on the following May 1805, in the ancient cathedral of
Milan, he assumed the Iron Crown of the Lombard kings,
saying as he did so, "God has given it to me; let him
beware who would touch it!"</p>

<p>The new order of knighthood, that of the Iron Crown,
with these words for its motto, arose out of this ceremony.</p>

<p>On the 8th of May, while on the road to Milan, Napoleon
expressed a wish to visit the battlefield of Marengo,
on which he had reconquered Italy five years before. All
the French troops in that part of Italy were therefore
mustered there, to the number of 30,000. Covered with
the hat and uniform which he wore on the day of that
memorable conflict&mdash;the Emperor passed the army in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
review on horseback, and distributed crosses of the Legion
of Honor, with the same ceremonies which had been
observed on the Champ de Mars and the same return of
enthusiastic devotion on the parts of the troops. "It was
remarked," says Bourrienne, "that the worms, who spare
neither the costumes of living kings, nor the bodies of
deceased heroes, had been busy with the trophies of Marengo,
which, nevertheless, Bonaparte wore at the review."
Napoleon did not continue his journey until after he had
laid the first stone of the monument consecrated to those
who had been slain on the battlefield, and on the same
day he made his entry into Milan. Meanwhile the activity
in France continued unabated, and scarcely a day
passed without some trifling engagement, brought on by
the rigorous pursuit of the squadrons of the French fleet,
as they advanced to Boulogne.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Emperor entered Paris after his return
from the coronation in Italy, before he learned that a new
coalition had been formed against him, and that England,
Russia, Austria and Sweden, with half a million men,
were preparing once more for war. The objects proposed
were, briefly, the independence of Holland and Switzerland;
the evacuation of Hanover, and the north of Germany
by the French troops; the restoration of Piedmont
to the King of Sardinia; and the complete evacuation of
Italy by France. Great Britain, besides affording the
assistance of her forces by sea and land, was to pay large
subsidies for supporting the armies of the coalition. Napoleon
had, in a great degree, penetrated the schemes of the
allied powers, but was not prepared for the sudden assumption
of arms by Austria without any declaration of war;
a measure which Austria justified by referring to the
increasing encroachments of France in Italy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>As the Emperor desired leisure to prosecute and perfect
the great public works he had begun, or projected, he
most earnestly wished for peace, and he again addressed
a letter to the King of England, and which was treated
with contempt. An envoy was sent to Frankfort-on-the-Main
to ascertain definitely whether Austria really
intended to trample another treaty in the dirt, and so soon
after the fatal day at Marengo. The messenger soon
returned with the best maps of the German Empire, and
opening them on the council table of the Tuileries, said:
"The Austrian general is advancing on Munich: the
Russian army is in motion, and Prussia will join them."</p>

<p>The Emperor of Russia had pushed on to Berlin to win
over the Prussian monarch to the great Bourbon coalition,
and to make the compact more impressive, he asked
his royal brother to visit with him the tomb of Frederick
the Great. They descended by torchlight to the vault,
and there, over the honored dust of Frederick, Francis,
his heir, took a solemn oath, as he pointed to the sword
of his ancestor as it lay on the coffin, to join the European
coalition. Some weeks afterwards Napoleon visited the
tomb as a conqueror, and said to his attendant, as he
seized the precious relics: "These orders and sword shall
witness no other such scene of perjury over the ashes of
Frederick!"</p>

<p>The young Emperor of France now gathered his eagles
to lead them toward the Danube. To the French Senate,
whom Napoleon informed of the hostile conduct of Russia
and Austria, the Emperor said: "I am about to quit my
capital to place myself at the head of my army in order
that I may render prompt assistance to my allies, and
defend the dearest interests of my people.... I groan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
for the blood which it will cost Europe; but it will be
the means of adding new lustre to the French name."
Another campaign against the kings of Europe was inevitable,
and he proceeded to achieve the destruction of Mack's
army, not as at Marengo by one general battle, but by a
series of grand manoeuvres, and a train of partial actions
necessary to execute them, which rendered assistance and
retreat alike impossible.</p>

<p>The great army that had been assembled on the coast
of France to invade England was now relieved from its
inactivity and directed to march upon the German frontiers.
The Count de Ségur, who had command of the
detachment of the Guard at the Tuileries, and accompanied
Napoleon on this campaign, relates in his "Memoirs" a
remarkable scene in the Emperor's private quarters at
Boulogne before Napoleon started for the frontier. The
Emperor had just received news that Admiral Villeneuve
had taken the French fleet to Ferrol and left the channel.
On learning this the Emperor at once decided that the
contemplated invasion of England was then impossible.
Ségur then says: "Sit there," Napoleon said to
M. Daru, then acting as intendant-general of the army
"and write." And then, without a transition, without
any apparent meditation, with his brief and imperious
accent, he dictated to him, without hesitation, the plan of
the campaign of Ulm as far as Vienna! The army of the
coast, fronting the ocean for more than two hundred
leagues, was at the first signal to turn round and march
on the Danube, in several columns! The order of the
marches, their duration, points of concentration, of reunion
of the columns, surprises, attacks, various movements,
the enemy's mistakes&mdash;all was foreseen.... The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
battlefields, the victories, even the dates on which we were
to enter Munich and Vienna&mdash;all was then written just as
it happened, and this two months in advance, at this very
hour of the 13th of August, and from this quarter-general
on the coast. Daru, however accustomed to the inspirations
of his chief, remained dumfounded, and he was even
more surprised when afterwards he saw these oracles
realized. The Emperor returned to Paris without delay,
and there laid before the Senate the state of the army
and announced the commencement of hostilities.</p>

<p>It was five years since the soldiers had been in battle;
and for two and a half years they had been waiting in
vain for an opportunity to cross over into England. It
would be difficult to form any conception then of their joy
or of their ardor when they learned they were going to be
employed in a great war. Old and young ardently longed
for battles, dangers, distant expeditions. They had conquered
the Austrians, the Prussians, the Russians; they
despised all the soldiers of Europe and did not imagine
there was an army in the world capable of resisting them.
They set off singing, and shouting, "Vive l'Empereur!"</p>

<p>At the same time Massena received orders to assume
the offensive in Italy, and force his way, if possible, into
the hereditary States of Austria. The two French armies,
one crossing the Rhine and the other pushing through the
Tyrolese, looked forward to a junction before the walls of
Vienna. After appointing Joseph Bonaparte to superintend
the government in his absence Napoleon quitted
Paris on the 24th of September 1805, accompanied as far as
Strasbourg by Josephine: here they separated. The Emperor
put himself at the head of his army and crossed the Rhine
on the 1st of October. He now begun a series of grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
manoeuvres and partial actions, requiring consummate
skill, with a view to the destruction of the great Austrian
army under General Mack.</p>

<p>Mack, at the head of the Austrian forces, established
his headquarters on the western frontier of Bavaria, at
Ulm. Prudence would have suggested that he occupy
the line of the river Inn, which, extending from the Tyrol
to the Danube at Passau, affords a strong defense to the
Austrian territory, and on which he might have awaited,
in comparative safety, the arrival of the Russian forces,
then on the march to aid Austria in the campaign.</p>

<p>Napoleon hastened to profit by Mack's error, and by
a combination of manoeuvres with his different divisions,
the great body of the French army advanced into the
heart of Germany by the left of the Danube, and then throwing
himself across the river, took ground in the
Austrian general's rear, when he expected to be assaulted
in front of Ulm. As it was, Mack's communication
with Vienna was interrupted, and he was completely
isolated.</p>

<p>Never was astonishment equal to that which filled all
Europe on the unexpected arrival of the French army.
It was supposed to be on the shores of the ocean, and
in twenty days, scarcely time enough for the report of
its march to spread to this point, it appeared on the
Rhine.</p>

<p>Napoleon did not effect his purpose of taking up a
position in the rear of Mack without resistance, but in the
various engagements with the different divisions of the
Austrian army at Wertingen, Gunzburgh, Memingen and
Elchingen, the French were uniformly successful. At
Memingen General Spangenburg was forced to capitulate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and 5,000 men laid down their arms. Not less than
20,000 prisoners fell into the hands of the French between
the 26th of September and the 13th of October.</p>

<p>The Emperor passed in review the dragoons of the village
of Zumershausen when he ordered to be brought before him
a dragoon named Marente, of the 4th regiment, one of the
gallant soldiers who, at the passage of the Lech, had
saved his captain, by whom he had, a few days before,
been cashiered from his rank. Napoleon then bestowed
upon him the eagle of the Legion of Honor.</p>

<p>"I have only done my duty," observed the soldier,
"my captain degraded me on account of some violation
of discipline but he knows I have always proved a good
soldier."</p>

<p>The Emperor expressed his satisfaction to the dragoons
for the bravery they had displayed at the battle of Wertingen
and ordered each regiment to present a dragoon,
on whom he also bestowed the decoration of the Legion of
Honor.</p>

<p>Napoleon looked upon the battle of Elchingen which followed
the actions at Wertingen and Gunzburgh as one of
the finest feats of arms that his army had ever accomplished.
From this field of battle he sent the Senate forty standards
taken by the French army in the various battles which
had succeeded that of Wertingen. "Since my entry on
this campaign," he wrote, "I have disposed of an army
of 100,000 men. I have taken nearly half of them
prisoners; the rest have either deserted, are killed,
wounded, or reduced to the greatest consternation ... Assisted
by Divine Providence I hope in a short time to
triumph over all my enemies."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>By the 13th of October General Mack found himself
completely surrounded at Ulm with a garrison of fully
20,000 good troops. On this day Napoleon made an exciting
address to his soldiers on the bridge of the Lech, amid
the most intense cold, the ground being covered with
snow, and the troops sunk to the knees in mud. He
warned them to expect a great battle, and explained
the desperate condition of the enemy. He was answered
with acclamations and repeated shouts of, "Vive
l' Empereur!" In listening to his exciting words, the
soldiers forgot their fatigues and privations and were
impatient to rush into the fight.</p>

<p>As Napoleon passed through a crowd of prisoners,
an Austrian colonel expressed his astonishment on
beholding the Emperor of the French drenched with rain,
covered with dirt, and as much, or even more fatigued
than the meanest drummer in his army. An aide-de-camp
present having explained to him what the Austrian
officer said, the Emperor ordered this answer to be given:
"Your master wished me to recollect that I was a soldier;
I hope that he will allow that the throne and the imperial
purple have not made me forget my original profession."</p>

<p>From the height of the Abbey of Elchingen Napoleon
now beheld the city of Ulm at his feet, commanded on
every side by his cannon; his victorious troops ready for
the assault, and the great Austrian army cooped up within
the walls. Four days later a flag of truce came from
General Mack.</p>

<p>Napoleon had called upon the commander to surrender,
and unlike the brave Wurmser, who held Mantua
to extremity during the campaign of Alvinzi, he capitulated
without hazarding a blow. On the previous day Mack had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
published a proclamation urging his troops to prepare for
the "utmost pertinacity of defense" and forbidding, on
the pain of death, the very word "surrender" to be
breathed within the walls of Ulm. He announced the
arrival of two powerful armies, one of Austrians, the
other of Russians, whose appearance "would presently
raise the blockade." He even declared his intention of
eating horseflesh rather than listen to any terms of capitulation!</p>

<p>On the morning of October 15th Napoleon finally resolved
to bring the affair to a close, and gave orders to Marshal
Ney to storm the heights of Michaelsberg. All at once
a battery unmasked by the Austrians, poured its grape-shot
upon the imperial group. Lannes, who was to flank
Ney, abruptly seized Napoleon's horse to lead him out of
the galling fire. The latter had taken up a position to
watch Ney, who had set his columns in motion. Changing
to a safe position, the Emperor saw this intrepid
leader climb the intrenchments raised on Michaelsberg,
and carry them with the bayonet. Lannes secured another
point of attack a moment later.</p>

<p>Napoleon then suspended the combat until the next
day, when he ordered a few shells to be thrown into Ulm,
and in the evening sent Ségur to General Mack summoning
him to surrender. The envoy had great difficulty
in getting into the place. He was led blindfold before
Mack, who, striving to conceal his anxiety, was nevertheless
unable to dissemble his surprise and grief on
learning the extent of his disaster and hopeless position.</p>

<p>On the 17th Mack signed articles by which hostilities
were immediately ceased and he with all his men agreed
to surrender(!) themselves as prisoners of war within ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
days, unless some Austrian or Russian force should appear
and attempt to raise the blockade. On the 19th, after a
personal visit to Napoleon's camp, Mack submitted to a
"revision" of the treaty, and on the 20th a formal evacuation
of Ulm took place.</p>

<p>Thirty-six thousand soldiers filed off and laid down
their arms before Napoleon and his staff. A large watchfire
had been made, near which the Emperor posted himself
to witness the ceremony. General Mack came forward
and delivered his sword, exclaiming, with grief:
"Here is the unfortunate Mack!" Napoleon received
him and his officers with the greatest courtesy. Eighteen
generals were dismissed on parole, an immense quantity
of ammunition of all sorts fell into the hands of the victor,
and a wagonful of Austrian standards was sent to Paris.</p>

<p>Napoleon enforced the strictest silence on his troops
while this ceremony, so painful to their enemies continued.
In one instance he instantly ordered out of his presence
one of his own generals from whom his quick ear caught
some witticism passed on the occasion.</p>

<p>All the Austrian officers were allowed to return home,
on giving their word of honor not to serve against
France until a general exchange of prisoners should take
place.</p>

<p>This campaign is perhaps unexampled in the history of
warfare for the greatness of its results in comparison with
the smallness of the expense at which they were obtained.
Of the French army, scarcely fifteen hundred men were
killed and wounded; while the Austrian army of almost
ninety thousand men was nearly annihilated; all, with the
exception of 15,000 who escaped, being killed, wounded,
or prisoners; and having lost also, 200 pieces of cannon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and ninety flags. It was a common remark among the
troops, "The Emperor has found a new method of carrying
on war; he makes us use our legs instead of our
bayonets." Five-sixths of the French army never fired
a shot, at which the troops were much mortified!</p>

<p>Massena was also successful in his advance from Lombardy,
the Archduke Charles, who commanded an army of
80,000 men for Austria, being forced to abandon Italy,
and Marshal Ney whom Napoleon had detached from his
own main army with orders to advance in the Tyrol, was
no less successful. The number of prisoners taken in this
campaign was so great that Napoleon distributed them
amongst the agriculturists that their work in the fields
might make up for the absence of the conscripts, whom
he had withdrawn from such labor.</p>

<p>Rumors of the approach of the Russians, headed by the
Emperor Alexander in person, came fast and frequent. The
divisions of Massena and Ney were now at the disposal of
Napoleon, who was concentrating his forces for the purpose
of attacking Vienna, and, with the main body,
now moved on the capital of the Austrian Emperor. The
Emperor Francis, perceiving that Vienna was incapable
of defense, quitted his palace on the 7th of November,
and proceeded to the headquarters of Alexander at
Brunn.</p>

<p>While Napoleon was riding on horseback on the Vienna
road, he perceived an open carriage approaching, in which
were seated a priest, and a lady bathed in tears. The
Emperor was dressed, as usual, in the uniform of a
colonel of the chasseurs of the guard. The lady did not
recognize him. He inquired the cause of her distress and
where she was going.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sir," said she, "I have been robbed, about two
leagues hence, by a party of soldiers, who have killed my
gardener. I am going to request that your emperor will
grant me a guard; he once knew my family well, and
lay under obligations to them."</p>

<p>"Your name?" inquired Napoleon.</p>

<p>"De Brunny" answered the lady. "I am the daughter
of M. de Marbeuf, formerly governor of Corsica."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to meet with you madame" exclaimed
Napoleon with the most charming frankness, "and to
have an opportunity of serving you,&mdash;I am the Emperor."</p>

<p>The lady expressed much surprise and passed on agreeing
to wait for the commander at headquarters. Here she
was furnished a piquet of chasseurs.</p>

<p>On the 13th the French entered Vienna, and Napoleon
took up his residence in the Imperial Palace of Schoenbrunn,
the home of the Austrian Cæsars. While
at this point Napoleon learned of the success of the English
at Trafalgar on October 19th,&mdash;the day after Mack
surrendered at Ulm. It was a battle sternly contested and
resulted in the final annihilation of the French fleet.
Great as the triumph was for England, it was dearly purchased&mdash;for
Nelson fell, mortally wounded, early in the
action. He lived just long enough to hear the cheers of
victory, and as he passed away, said, "Thank God! I
have done my duty!"</p>

<p>The tidings of Trafalgar served but as a new stimulus
to Napoleon's energy. "Heaven has given the empire
of the sea to England," he said, "but to us has fate
decreed the dominion of the land." But though such
signal success had crowned the commencement of the
campaign, it was necessary to defeat the haughty Rus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>sians
before the object of the war could be considered as
attained. The broken and shattered remnant of the Austrian
forces had rallied from different quarters around the
yet untouched army of Alexander; Napoleon had therefore
waited until the result of his skillful combinations had
drawn around him the greatest force he could expect to
collect, ere venturing upon a general battle. He then
quitted Vienna and put himself at the head of his columns
which soon found themselves within reach of the Russian
and Austrian forces, at length combined and ready for
action, and under the eye of their emperors.</p>

<p>Now it was to be a battle of three emperors,&mdash;France,
Russia and Austria. Napoleon fixed his headquarters at
Brunn, where he arrived on the 20th of November, and
riding over the plain between this point and Austerlitz, a
village about two miles from Brunn, said to his generals:
"Study this field well,&mdash;we shall, ere long, have to contest
it."</p>

<p>Napoleon, on learning that the Emperor Alexander was
personally in the hostile camp, sent Savary to present his
compliments to that sovereign, and of course "incidentally
to observe as much as he could of the numbers and
condition of the enemy's troops." The messenger reported
that the Russians labored under a belief that the reverses
of the previous campaign were the result of unpardonable
cowardice among the Austrians, and the first general
battle would show the sort of warriors the Russians were.
Savary said that from the conversations he had for three
days with nearly thirty coxcombs about the person of
Alexander, that presumption, inconsiderateness, and
imprudence, reigned in the decisions of the military as
much as in the political cabinet, and that an army so conducted
must of necessity commit great faults.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>The Czar sent a young aide-de-camp to return the compliment
carried by Savary, and he found the French
soldiery engaged in fortifying their position&mdash;a position
which Napoleon had some time before determined to
occupy; but the negotiations were of no avail: Napoleon
wanted either an overwhelming battle or peace. The
aide-de-camp sent by Alexander was impressed with what
appeared to him to be evidence of fear and apprehension
on the part of the French. The placing of strong guards
and fortifications, thrown up with such haste, appeared
to him like the precautions of an army half beaten.
The Russian prince discussed every point with an air of
impertinence difficult to be conceived. He spoke to Napoleon
as if he had been conversing with a Russian officer;
but the Emperor repressed his indignation, and the young
man returned under a full conviction that the French
army was on the brink of ruin. Several old Austrian
generals, who had made campaigns against Napoleon, are
said to have warned the Russian council against too much
confidence as they were to march against old soldiers and
able officers. They said they had seen Napoleon, when
reduced to a handful of men, repossess himself of victory,
under the most difficult circumstances, by rapid and unforseen
operations, in which manner he had destroyed
numerous armies. The presumptuous young man declared
that the presence of the Russian Emperor would inspire
the troops to victory especially as they would be aided by
the picked troops of the imperial guard of Russia.</p>

<p>On the 1st of December, on seeing the Russians begin
to descend from a chain of heights on which they might
have received an attack with great advantage to themselves,
and have remained in safety until the Archduke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Charles could come up with the 80,000 men in Bohemia
and Hungary, Napoleon exclaimed rapturously, as he
witnessed the rash manoeuvre: "In twenty-four hours
that army will be mine!" In the meantime, withdrawing
his outposts and concentrating his forces, he continued
to imitate a conscious inferiority, which was far from
existing. In the order of the day (December 1) before the
battle of Austerlitz, Napoleon inserted the following
proclamation:</p>

<p>"Soldiers, the Russians are before you, to avenge the
Austrian army at Ulm. They consist of the same battalions
you beat at Hollenbrun and have constantly pursued.
The positions we occupy are formidable; and, while they
march to my right, they shall present me their flank.&mdash;Soldiers,
I will direct myself all your battalions. I shall
keep at a distance from the firing, if, with your accustomed
bravery, you carry confusion and disorder into the
enemy's ranks; but, should victory appear for a moment
doubtful, you shall see your Emperor expose himself to
the first blows; for victory cannot hesitate on this day,
in which the honor of the French infantry, of so much
importance to the whole army, is concerned. Suffer not
the ranks to be thinned, under pretense of carrying off
the wounded; but let each man be well persuaded that
we must conquer the hirelings of England, who are
animated with so deep a hatred of our nation. This victory
must terminate our campaign; when we shall resume
our winter quarters, and be joined by the new armies
forming in France. The peace which I make will be
worthy of my people, of you and myself.</p>

</div>

<p>At one o'clock on the morning of the 2nd of December,
Napoleon, having slept for an hour by a watchfire, got
on horseback and proceeded to reconnoitre the front of
his position. He wished to do so without being recognized,
but the soldiers penetrated the secret, and, lighting
great fires of straw along the line, 80,000 men received
him from post to post with great enthusiasm. They
reminded him that it was the anniversary of his coronation,
and declared that they would celebrate the day in a
manner worthy of his glory.</p>

<p>"Only promise us," cried one old grenadier, "that
you will keep yourself out of the fire: I promise you in
the name of the grenadiers of the army that you will have
to fight only with your eyes, and we will bring you the
flags and artillery of the Russian army to celebrate the
anniversary of your coronation."</p>

<p>"I will do so," answered the Emperor, "but I shall
be with the reserve <i>until you need us</i>." This promise
Napoleon soon repeated in his proclamation. As he threw
down his pen after signing this document, he exclaimed:
"This is the noblest evening of my life; but I
shall lose too many of these brave fellows to-morrow.
The anguish which I experience at this idea makes me
feel they are really my children; and truly I am vexed
with myself for these sensations, as I fear they will unman
me on the field of battle."</p>

<p>In his preparations for this decisive contest which he
made immediately, ten battalions of the Imperial Guard,
with ten of Oudinot's division, were to be kept in reserve
in the rear of the line, under the eyes of Napoleon himself,
who destined them, with forty field-pieces, to act wherever
the fate of battle should render their services most
necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"The battle was planned by Napoleon in every detail,"
says Ségur, "just as he had planned the strategic movements
of the army. In the early morning he sent for all his
aides-de-camp to come to the small house where he had
spent the night. We had a slight repast, which, like himself,
we ate standing; after which, putting on his sword,
he said, 'Now gentlemen, let us go and begin a great day.'
We all ran to our horses. A moment afterwards we saw, on
the top of the hill which the soldiers called 'the Emperor's
hill,' arriving from the various points of our line, followed
each by their aides-de-camp, all the chiefs of our army
corps, Murat, Lannes, Bernadotte, Soult, Davoust,&mdash;all
coming to receive final orders. If I were to live as long
as the world shall last, I would never forget that scene."</p>

<p>After a hazy, misty daybreak, the sun at last arose with
uncommon brilliancy, so bright in fact that "the sun of
Austerlitz" afterwards fell into a proverb with the French
soldiery, who hailed similar dawns with exultation and as
a sure omen of victory. The Emperor said, as he passed
in front of several regiments: "Soldiers, we must finish
this campaign by a thunderbolt which shall confound
the pride of our enemies." Immediately they raised their
hats on the bayonets' points and cries of, "Live the Emperor!"
formed the actual signal for battle. A moment
afterwards the horizon cleared up and as the sun darted
forth its glistening rays the cannonading was heard at the
extremity of the right line. The great battle of Austerlitz
had begun.</p>

<p>At the opening of the engagement, Kutusoff, the
Russian general-in-chief, fell into a snare laid for him by
Napoleon, and sent a large division of his army to turn
the right of the French. His troops, detached for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
purpose, met with unexpected resistance from Davoust,
and were held in check. Napoleon at once seized the
opportunity given him by the enemy in leaving a deep gap
in their line, and upon that space Soult forthwith poured
a force which entirely cut off all communication between
the Russian centre and left.</p>

<p>The Czar quickly perceived the fatal consequences of
the movement, and ordered his guards to rush to the
eminence called the hill of Pratzen, where the encounter
was taking place, and beat back Soult. The Russians
succeeded in driving the French before them, when Napoleon
ordered Bessieres to their rescue with the Imperial
Guards. The Russians had become somewhat disordered
from the impatience of their temporary victory, and
although they resisted Bessieres sternly, they were finally
broken and fled. The regiment of the Grand Duke Constantine,
who gallantly led the Russians, was now annihilated
and the duke only escaped by the fleetness of his
horse.</p>

<p>The French centre now advanced, and the charges of
Murat's cavalry were most decisive, while the left wing,
under the command of Lannes, marched forward, <i>en
echelons</i>, by regiments, in the same manner as if they had
been exercising by divisions. A tremendous cannonade
then took place along the whole line; two hundred and
three pieces of cannon, and nearly two hundred thousand
men, being engaged, so that it was indeed a giant combat.
Success could not be doubtful: in a moment the Russians
were all but routed, their colonel, artillery, standards
and everything being already captured. At 1 o'clock the
victory was decided; it had never been doubtful for a
moment; and not a man of the reserves was required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>From the heights of Austerlitz the Emperors of Russia
and Austria beheld the total ruin of their centre as they
had already of their left. The right wing only remained
unbroken, it having contested well the impetuous charge
of Lannes; but Napoleon could now gather round them
on all sides, and, his artillery plunging incessant fire on
them from the heights, they at length found it impossible
to hold their ground and were driven from position to
position. They were at last forced down into a hollow
where some frozen lakes offered them the only means of
escape from the closing cannonade. As they did so the
French broke the ice about them by a storm of shot from
200 heavy cannon, and nearly 2,000 men died on the spot,
some swept away by artillery, but the greater part being
drowned beneath the broken ice.</p>

<p>The cries of the dying Russians, as they sank beneath
the waters, were drowned, however, by the victorious
shouts of the French, who were pursuing the scattering
remnants of the enemy in every direction. In the bulletin
of the engagement Napoleon compared the scene to that
at Aboukir, "when the sea was covered with turbans."</p>

<p>The Emperor had addressed his soldiers on the evening
preceding the battle to heighten their courage, and presage
to them the victory; he did not forget to address
himself to them again after the fight, and felicitate them
upon having so nobly contributed to verify his prediction.
"Soldiers," he said to them, "You have on this day of
Austerlitz justified all that which I expected from your
intrepidity. You have decorated your eagles with immortal
glory. When all that is necessary to assure the happiness
and prosperity of our country is accomplished, I will
lead you back to France. There you will be the objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of my tenderest solicitude. My people will joyously greet
you again, and it will suffice for you to say: 'I was at
the battle of Austerlitz,' and for them to reply, 'Behold
a brave man!'"</p>

<p>In later years Napoleon said of this engagement: "I
have fought thirty battles like that, but I have never seen
so decisive a victory, or one where the chances were so
unevenly balanced." At another time while at St.
Helena he said, "If I had not conquered at Austerlitz I
should have had all Prussia on me."</p>

<p>It was with great difficulty that the Emperors of Russia
and Austria rallied some fragments of their armies
around them, and, terror-stricken, effected their retreat.
With the conqueror there remained 20,000 prisoners, 40
pieces of artillery, and all the standards of the Imperial
Guard of Russia. Such was the battle of Austerlitz, or
as the French soldiers delighted to call it, "The Battle of
the Emperors"; and thus did Napoleon's army fulfill
its pledge to celebrate the anniversary of his coronation.</p>

<p>The fleeing Emperors halted at midnight for council,
and decided to send a messenger to Napoleon at daylight
with proposals for peace. The envoy was courteously
received, and arrangements were at once made for a meeting
of the Austrian and French Emperors at ten o'clock
the next day. They met about three leagues from Austerlitz,
near a mill. Napoleon was the first to arrive on
the ground; he at once ordered that two fires be made,
and with a squadron of his Guard drawn up at a distance
of about two hundred paces, awaited the arrival of
Francis and his personal suite. When Francis came
in sight, accompanied by several princes and generals,
and an escort of Hungarian cavalry, Napoleon advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
to his carriage, and embraced him. The two Emperors,
each with an attendant, then went to one of the fires near
the entrance to a military hut, while the suites of the two
sovereigns drew around the other fire, a few paces distant.</p>

<p>"Such are the palaces you have compelled me to
occupy for these three months," said Napoleon, pointing to
his modest quarters.</p>

<p>"You have made such good use of them," answered
Francis, "that you ought not to complain of their accommodation."</p>

<p>The defeated Emperor is represented as having thrown
the blame of the war upon the English. "They are a set
of merchants," he said, "who would set the continent on
fire, in order to secure themselves the commerce of the
world."</p>

<p>When the two great leaders separated, after an interview
lasting an hour, they again embraced, Napoleon saying
in the hearing of the gentlemen of the suites,&mdash;Prince John
of Lichtenstein, near Francis, and Marshal Berthier, near
Napoleon&mdash;: "I agree to it; but your Majesty must not
make war upon me again." "No, I promise you I will
not," said Francis in reply; "I will keep my word"&mdash;a
promise that was soon violated.</p>

<p>It was understood that the Emperor of Russia, although
not present, was to abide by the agreement for an armistice.
Alexander so assured Marshal Davoust, who had
pursued him the night of the battle, and the Russians
were allowed by Napoleon to retire unmolested to their
own territory, on the royal word of Francis that Russia
would adhere to his ally of Austria.</p>

<p>"The Russian army is surrounded," said Napoleon to
Francis; "Not a man can escape me but I wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
oblige their Emperor, and will stop the march of my
columns if your Majesty promises me that these Russians
shall evacuate Germany, and the Austrian and Prussian
parts of Poland." "It is the purpose of the Emperor
Alexander to do so," was the reply. No other engagement
was required of the Czar than his word.</p>

<p>When the negotiations had been completed, and the
Emperor Francis had departed, Napoleon walked hurriedly
to and fro for a short time, and after a deep silence he
was heard to say: "I have acted very unwisely. I could
have followed up my victory, and taken up the whole of
the Austrian and Russian armies. They are both entirely
in my power. But&mdash;let it be. It will at least cause some
less tears to be shed."</p>

<p>Napoleon then went over the field of battle, ordering
the wounded to be removed, when some of those unfortunates,
forgetting their sufferings asked, "Is the victory
quite certain?" The foot guards of the Emperor, not
having been permitted to engage, actually wept and
insisted upon doing something to identify them with the
victory.</p>

<p>"Be satisfied," said Napoleon, "you are the reserve;
it will be better if you have nothing to do today."</p>

<p>The commander of the artillery of the imperial Russian
guard having lost his cannon, met the French Emperor
and said, "Sire, order me to be shot, I have lost my
cannon."</p>

<p>"Young man," replied Napoleon, "I esteem your
grief; but one may be beaten by my army, and still retain
some pretension to glory."</p>

<p>The brief campaign was followed by a treaty with the
Emperor of Austria, signed December 15th, 1805, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
another with Prussia, signed December 26th at Vienna.
The victor of Austerlitz made his own terms in the negotiations.
Austria gave up the last of her Italian usurpations
to be annexed to the Kingdom of Italy, and the
Tyrol to Bavaria, and yielded other stipulations which
the conqueror demanded, but which were so moderate
that they excited the wonder and admiration of all
Europe.</p>

<p>Previous to Napoleon's departure for Schoenbrunn on
the 27th of December he issued the following proclamation
to his army:</p>

<p>"Soldiers! Peace between myself and the Emperor of
Austria is signed. You have, in this late season of the
year, made two campaigns. You have performed everything
I expected. I am setting out for my capital. I
have promoted and distributed rewards to those who have
most distinguished themselves. I will perform everything
I have promised. You have seen that your Emperor has
shared all your dangers and fatigues; you shall likewise
behold him surrounded by all that grandeur and splendor
which become the sovereign of the first nation in the world.
In the beginning of the month of May, I will give a grand
festival in Paris; you shall all be there. We will celebrate
the memory of those who, in these campaign have
fallen on the field of honor. The world shall see that we
are ready to follow their example, and, if necessary, do
more than we have done, against those who suffer themselves
to be misled by the gold of the eternal enemy of the
continent."</p>

<p>The news of the success of the army was received
with the greatest enthusiasm by the majority of the
French people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame de Rémusat in writing to her husband from
Paris after the receipt of the news of the battle of Austerlitz,
said: "You cannot imagine how excited everyone
is. Praise of the Emperor is on everyone's lips; The most
recalcitrant are obliged to lay down their arms, and to
say with the Emperor of Russia, 'He is a man of destiny.'"</p>

<p>The campaign had consolidated the Empire of Napoleon,
and when he returned to France he was received
with exultation by the citizens, who tendered him fête
after fête such as had not been witnessed at the capital
for years. This was followed by the elevation of many of
his kinsmen and heroes to thrones of pomp and power,
coronation following coronation in rapid succession, princedoms
and dukedoms being accompanied with grants of
extensive estates in the countries which the French armies
had conquered. From that moment, the fanaticism of
military glory quite effaced the few remaining impressions
made by the love of liberty.</p>

THE BATTLE OF JENA</h2>

<p class="p2">The establishment of the Confederation of the Rhine,
which was one of the great consequences of Austerlitz,
rendered Napoleon in effect, sovereign of a large part of
Germany. The kings of Bavaria and Wurtemberg,
Prince Murat, the Grand Duke of Berg, and several other
sovereigns of Germany, had leagued together in an alliance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
with the French Empire; and they constituted so formidable
a power that the Emperor added a new title to his
name&mdash;the "Protector" of this confederacy. Thus Napoleon
became sovereign of a principal part of Germany,
and his allies were obliged to furnish, at his call, 60,000
armed men. The only method of counteracting the consolidation
of French power over all Germany seemed to
be that of creating another confederacy in the Northern
circles, capable of balancing the league of the Rhine, and
to be known as the Northern Alliance. This alliance
Napoleon determined to suppress. The relations between
France and Prussia continued in an unsettled state, Prussia
refusing on the one hand to embrace the Confederation
proposed by the cabinet of Berlin, and yet declining
on the other to form part of the Rhenish league to which
Bonaparte had frequently and urgently invited it.</p>

<p>A year had elapsed since the Emperor of Russia had
signed the famous treaty of Potsdam, wheedling the pliant
King of Prussia and his wife with all sorts of promises, including
an offer on the part of England to pay the costs of
another campaign against Napoleon and his Empire. For
some weeks strong hopes were entertained of a satisfactory
conclusion to peace overtures, but in the end the negotiations
broke up, on the refusal of Napoleon to concede
Malta to England, unless England would permit him to
conquer Sicily from the unfortunate sovereign whose
Italian kingdom had already been transferred to his
brother Joseph.</p>

<p>The death of Fox, according to Napoleon himself,
was the immediate cause of the failure of these negotiations.
The Emperor maintained that had the great
English statesman lived&mdash;he died on the 23rd of January,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
1806&mdash;the negotiations would have been resumed and
pushed to a successful close. When the Emperor of Russia
went to Berlin he offered Prussia all the forces of his
own great Empire. War-like preparations of every kind
filled the Kingdom of Prussia during August and September
1806. Notwithstanding the protestations made almost
daily by the Prussian government, through its minister
at Paris, towards the middle of August her preparations
assumed such a decided character that her real object
could no longer be concealed. A friendly letter was even
dispatched from the King of Prussia to Napoleon and the
French ambassador at Berlin was treated with due consideration
but which was far from honest at heart.</p>

<p>On the 21st of September Napoleon wrote to the princes
of the Confederation of the Rhine, requesting them to furnish
their contingent troops for his army, and which was
complied with, according to treaty. On the 25th the
Emperor quitted his imperial residence to place himself
at the head of the army. While at the theatre at St.
Cloud he received a dispatch from Murat containing an
account of an attack made on French troops by some
Prussian detachments. "I see they are determined to try
us," he said to Count Rapp and orders were immediately
given to prepare for departure to the frontier. He
arrived at Mayence on the 28th and on the 1st of October
passed the Rhine.</p>

<p>On this same day the Prussian minister at Paris
presented a note to Talleyrand, Minister of Foreign
Affairs, an ultimatum in which Prussia demanded, among
other things, that the formation of a Confederacy in the
North of Germany should no longer be thwarted by
French interference, to renounce the kingdoms of Holland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and Italy, and that the French troops within the territories
of the Rhenish league should recross the Rhine into
France by the 8th of the same month of October,&mdash;a virtual
declaration of war.</p>

<p>The conduct of Prussia in thus rushing into hostilities,
without waiting for the advance of her allies, the Russians,
was as rash as her holding back from Austria
during the campaign of Austerlitz was cowardly. Napoleon
had not patience to finish reading this document,
conveying those demands, but threw it down with
contempt.</p>

<p>Napoleon made answer to the Prussian note from his
headquarters at Bamberg on October 6th. He addressed
a proclamation to his army to inform them of the enemy
they were about to fight. "Soldiers," said he, "the war-cry
has been heard at Berlin; for two months our provocation
has been increased each day ... Let us march&mdash;let
the Prussian army meet with the same fate it evinced
fourteen years ago on the plains of Champagne." Thiers,
the eminent historian, says in his "History of the Consulate
and the Empire of France under Napoleon": "It
was the height of imprudence on the part of Prussia to
enter into a contest with Napoleon at a moment when the
French army, returning from Austerlitz, was still in the
heart of Germany, and more capable of acting than any
army ever was."</p>

<p>It was evident that Napoleon did not feel the least concern
about the approaching war. He wrote to his brothers
in Naples and in Holland at this time assuring them that
the present struggle would be terminated more speedily
than the preceding. He called upon them to observe in
what manner a German sovereign still dared to insult the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
soldiers of Austerlitz. Napoleon was then on the German
side of the Rhine in person. The Prussian Council had
directed their army to advance towards the French instead
of lying on their own frontier, and the army accordingly
invaded the Saxon provinces. The Elector of Saxony
was compelled to accept the alliance which the cabinet of
Berlin urged on him, and reluctantly joined his troops
with those of Prussia.</p>

<p>At Bamberg, on the same day he issued his proclamation
to his soldiers, Napoleon said to Berthier: "Marshal,
we have a rendezvous of honor appointed for the 8th; a
Frenchman never fails to keep them; but as we are told
that a beautiful queen wishes to be a witness of the fight,
let us be courteous, and march, without sleeping, for
Saxony." Napoleon alluded to the Queen of Prussia who
was with the Prussian army, dressed as an Amazon, wearing
the uniform of her regiment of dragoons, "writing
twenty letters a day" said the first bulletin sent to Paris,
"to fan the flame in all parts."</p>

<p>No sooner did Napoleon learn that the Prussians had
advanced into the heart of Saxony than he formed his
plan of campaign: and they, persisting in their advance,
and taking up a position on the Saale, afforded him
the means of repeating at their expense, the very manoeuvres
which had ruined the Austrians in the preceding
campaign. The French commander at once perceived
that the Prussian army was extended upon too wide a line,
thus enabling him the better to destroy it in detail. He
also discovered that the enemy had all its principal stores
and magazines at Naumburg to the rearward, and he
resolved to commence operations by an attempt to turn
the flank and seize the magazines ere the main body of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the Prussians, lying at Weimar, could be aware of his
movement. The Emperor quitted Bamberg on the 8th,
at three in the morning, and arrived on the same day at
Cronach. Every corps of the army was then in motion.</p>

<p>The French came forward in three great divisions; the
corps of Ney and Soult in the direction of Hof; Davoust,
Murat and Bernadotte towards Saalburg and Schleiz, and
Lannes and Augereau upon Coburg and Saalfeld. These
last generals were opposed at Saalfeld with much firmness
by Prince Louis of Prussia, cousin-german to
the king, who imprudently abandoned the bridge
over the Saale,&mdash;which he might have defended with
success,&mdash;and came out into the open plain where his
troops were overpowered by the French. Fighting hand
to hand with a subaltern who ran up to him and cried,
"Surrender, General!" the brave young officer in
brilliant uniform and adorned with all his decorations,
replied with a sabre cut, and was immediately struck down
by a mortal thrust in the face with a sabre, which
occasioned it to be remarked in the second bulletin
that "the first blow of the war had killed one of its
authors."</p>

<p>Prince Frederick Christian Louis of Prussia had been very
impatient to commence the war and urged and hastened
hostilities. He was, besides, a man of great courage and
talent. Rapp in his "Memoirs" says: "Napoleon,
who did not like this petulant eagerness, was conversing
with us one evening respecting the generals of the enemy's
army. Some one present happened to mention Prince
Louis. 'As for him' said he, 'I foretell that he will be
killed in this campaign.' Who could have thought the
prediction would so soon have been fulfilled?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prussians fled, leaving the bridge which gave the
French access to the country behind the Saale. The flank
of the Prussian position was turned; the French army
passed entirely around them, and Napoleon seized and
blew up the magazines at Naumburg. The explosion
announced to the King of Prussia and his generalissimo,
the Duke of Brunswick, that Napoleon was in their rear.
From this moment the Prussians were isolated and completely
cut off from all their resources&mdash;as completely as
the army of Mack was at Ulm the year before. The
engagement at Schleiz contributed to hasten the retreat
of the enemy which threw away upon the roads a great
number of muskets and hats, and leaving in the hands of
the French 400 prisoners and as many killed or wounded.
But the moral effect of the action was greater than the
material, the Prussians learning for the first time the sort
of soldiers they had to deal with.</p>

<p>Napoleon was extremely pleased with this first action
at Schleiz, as it proved how little the Prussian cavalry,
though excellently mounted and very skillful in the management
of its horses, was to be feared by his solid
infantry and bold horse soldiers.</p>

<p>The Duke of Brunswick who flattered himself that the
French could not debouch, hastily endeavored to concentrate
his forces for the purpose of cutting his way back
again to the frontier which he had so rashly abandoned.
Napoleon, meanwhile, had posted his divisions so as to
watch the chief passages of the Saale, and awaited the
coming of his outwitted opponent.</p>

<p>The manifesto of Frederick William had arrived at the
capital a day or two after Napoleon had quitted Paris for
the camp, and it was now that he found time to answer it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
by calling on his own marshals to witness how "The
French army has done as it was bidden; this is the 8th of
October, and we have evacuated the territories of the
Confederation of the Rhine!"</p>

<p>To the King of Prussia Napoleon wrote: "Believe me,
my strength is such that your forces cannot long balance
the victory. But wherefore shed so much blood? To
what purpose? I will hold to your Majesty the same
language I held to the Emperor Alexander two days
before the battle of Austerlitz: 'Why should we make
our subjects slay each other? I do not prize a victory which
is purchased by the lives of so many of my children.' If I
were just commencing my military career, and if I had any
reason to fear the chances of war, this language would be
wholly misplaced. Sire, your Majesty will be vanquished;
you will have compromised the repose of your life, the
existence of your subjects, without the shadow of a pretext.
At present you are uninjured, and may treat with me in
a manner conformable with your rank; before a month
has passed you will treat, but in a different position."</p>

<p>On learning of the fall of Naumburg, the Prussian king
knew full well the imminent danger of his position. His
army was at once set in motion in two great masses, one
commanded by himself, advancing towards Naumburg,
the other attempting in like manner to force its passage
through the French line in the neighborhood of Jena.
The king's march was arrested at Auerstadt by Davoust,
who, after a severely contested action, at length repelled
the assailant. Napoleon himself, meanwhile, was engaged
with the other great body of the Prussians.</p>

<p>Arriving on the evening of the 13th of October at Jena,
he at once perceived that the enemy was ready to attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the advance next morning, while his own heavy train
was still thirty-six hours' march in his rear. "But,"
as the Emperor said in his bulletin of the battle fought
next day, "there are moments in war when no consideration
can balance the advantage of being before-hand
with the enemy, and of attacking first."</p>

</div>

<p>On the heights from Jena to Landgrafenberg he placed
Gazan's division on the left, in the right Souchet's division,
and in the centre and rear the foot guard. He made
the latter encamp in a square of 4000 men, and in the
centre of this square overlooking the plains below, he
established his bivouac. Ever since that time the people
have called that height "Napoleonsberg," marking by
a heap of rough stones the spot where the Emperor had
spent part of that memorable night.</p>

<p>The Emperor labored hard, torch in hand, directing
and encouraging his soldiery to cut a road through a
ledge of rocks and draw up by that means such light
guns as he had at command to a position on a lofty
plateau in front of Jena. It was a most formidable position,
and one that was destined to prove more decisive
than that of a much larger one might have been under
other circumstances. Napoleon spent the entire night
among the men, helped drag the guns to the cliffs, and
offering rewards for every piece of cannon that should be
placed on the heights. He reminded his followers that
the Prussians were about to fight&mdash;not for honor, but for
their lives.</p>

<p>"The night," says Napoleon, "offered a spectacle
worthy of observation; that of the two armies, one of
which embraced with its front an extent of six leagues,
and peopled the atmosphere with its fires, the other, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
apparent fires were concentrated in a small point, and in
both encampments activity and motion. The fires of the
two armies were within half cannon-shot; the sentinels
almost touched each other, and not a movement could be
made without being heard."</p>

<p>At about 5 o'clock Napoleon asked Marshal Soult,
"Shall we beat them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if they are there," answered the marshal; "I
am only afraid they have left."</p>

<p>At that moment the first musketry was heard,
"There they are," said the Emperor joyfully; "there
they are! The business is beginning."</p>

<p>Napoleon then rode through the ranks addressing his
soldiers. He bade them remember that, a year ago, at the
same period, they had conquered Ulm and recommended
that they be on their guard against the Prussian cavalry,
which had been represented as so formidable. "This
cavalry," he said, "must be destroyed here, before our
squares, as we crushed the Russian infantry at Austerlitz."
He told them that if they should succeed in
endeavoring to fight their way through any point, the
corps that would suffer them to pass, must forfeit its
honor and character.</p>

<p>The soldiers answered his animated discourse by
demanding to be led against the enemy; and the cries of,
"Forward! Let us march!" were heard in every
direction.</p>

<p>Again, as at Austerlitz, a cloud of mist completely
enveloped the contending hosts. Both armies were almost
in the heat of battle before the different divisions were
distinguishable. Augereau commanded the right wing,
Soult the left, Cannes the centre and Murat the reserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
of cavalry. Escorted by men carrying torches, Napoleon
again went along in front of the troops, talking to the
officers and soldiers. He exhorted them to keep on their
guard against the Prussian cavalry and to receive it in
square with their usual firmness. His words everywhere
drew forth shouts of "Forward! Vive l'Empereur!"
At that moment the corps of Lannes set itself in motion
on a signal from Napoleon.</p>

<p>The battle began on the right and left and the conflict
proved terrible. Davoust, in particular, was placed in a
situation sufficient to try a man of the most determined
courage and firmness but Bernadotte refused to support
him. He paraded around Apolda, while 26,000 French
troops were engaged with 60,000 picked men, commanded
by the Duke of Brunswick and the King of Prussia. Thus,
says General Gourgaud, he caused the death of five or six
thousand Frenchmen and hazarded the success of the day,
for which he experienced a very short disgrace. Napoleon
on this occasion observed that Bernadotte did not behave
well, and that he would have felt gratified had Davoust
been defeated; "but," added the Emperor, "the affair
reflects the highest honor on the conqueror, and the more
so, as Bernadotte rendered his situation a most difficult
one." Bernadotte's conduct was such that a decree was
signed by Napoleon that must have resulted in his being
shot, but out of regard to his wife the Emperor destroyed
the order the moment he was about to put it into the hands
of one of his officers.</p>

<p>A hand to hand struggle followed the first charge of
the Prussians. It was received by Soult and was a doubtful
engagement until Ney appeared with a fresh division
and drove the Prussians back. Nothing but the smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of battle now obstructed the view, the famous sun of Napoleon
having mounted the heavens was throwing a
flood of light on a terrific engagement. Charge after
charge followed, both sides maintaining their positions
with firmness and valor. The commanders were constantly
executing manoeuvres as though on parade. At
one time the Emperor observed Ney, whom he had supposed
to be in the rear, engaged with the Prussians. He
hastened up greatly displeased, but on discovering the
brave marshal defending himself in the centre of two weak
squares against the whole of the Prussian cavalry, his
displeasure gave way to admiration, and an immediate
relief was ordered and brought up by Bertrand and Lannes.
During the time that elapsed before relief arrived
he fought as intrepidly as before, and was not in the least
disconcerted by his hazardous position. Davoust's plans
were so well laid, and his generals and troops displayed
such courage and skill, that Blucher, with 12,000 cavalry,
had not the satisfaction of penetrating through a single
company. The king, the guards, and the whole army,
attacked the French without obtaining better success.
Amidst the deluge of fire that surrounded them on all
sides, they preserved all their national gaiety. A French
soldier, nick-named "the Emperor" impatient at the obstinacy
of the Prussian guards, exclaimed, "On with me,
grenadiers! Come, follow the Emperor!" when, rushing
into the thickest of the battle, the troops followed,
and the enemy was penetrated. For this deed he was
raised to the rank of a corporal.</p>

<p>Napoleon, field-glass in hand, at length ordered a general
onslaught all along the lines, to be followed by a bold
charge of Murat's cavalry at a point where the Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
had detected a weakness in the enemy's lines. As the
signal blast for advancing was sounded, the eager squadrons
that had been smelling the smoke of battle for hours
with impatience, rushed onward to glory or to death.
On, on they charged with all the vehemence and impetuosity
of the French cavalryman, each of whom believed
that on him, and him alone, rested the fate of the day,
and as on so many similar occasions, they were victorious.
The sturdy Prussian columns were broken,&mdash;infantry,
cavalry, guards and grenadiers were mowed down by
thousands. The French infantry gave fresh proof of their
valor and sustained their reputation at this engagement.
In one of the charges which the divisions under Morand
had to sustain from the numerous Prussian cavalry under
Prince Henry, the 17th regiment, before presenting arms,
placed their caps at the ends of their bayonets, crying,
"Vive l'Empereur!" "Why not fire then?" exclaimed
Colonel Lanusse who apprehended the enemy would be
upon them before they were ready. "Oh, time enough
for that" they replied, "at fifteen paces you shall see."
In fact a murderous discharge at that distance made the
Prussians turn their horses' heads and retire.</p>

<p>The ardor of the troops on this important day was such
that some corps, which circumstances prevented from
taking part in the engagement, loudly expressed their
dissatisfaction. One of these traits is sufficiently characteristic
of the soldier and the Emperor under whose eyes
they fought. At an early period of the conflict, while
the French cavalry was anxiously expected, Napoleon
seeing his infantry wings in a state of agitation, being
threatened by the enemy's cavalry, set off at a full gallop to
direct the manoeuvres and change the front into squares.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
The infantry of the imperial guard, seeing all the rest of
the troops engaged, while the Emperor left them in inaction,
many voices were heard to cry "Forward!" "Who
is that?" asked the Emperor quickly, as he presented
himself in front of the battalions; "This is some beardless
young man, who wishes to anticipate what I intend
to do. Let him wait until he has commanded in thirty
pitched battles, before he pretends to give me advice."</p>

<p>Out of the 70,000 Prussians who had appeared on the
field of battle, not a single corps remained entire, not one
retreated in order. Out of the 100,000 French, composed
of the corps of Marshals Soult, Lannes, Augereau, Ney,
Murat and the Guard, not more than 50,000 had fought,
and they had been sufficient to overthrow the Prussian
army.</p>

<p>This rout ended in the complete breaking up of the
Prussian army, horse and foot all flying together, in the
confusion of panic, upon the road to Weimar. At that
point the fugitives met and mingled with their brethren,
flying as confusedly as themselves, from Auerstadt.</p>

<p>In his account of the battle of Jena Napoleon spoke
with pleasure of the enthusiasm shown by his soldiers
during the heat of battle. In conclusion he said: "In
so warm a fight, in which the enemy lost almost all their
generals, we should thank that Providence which watched
over our army, that no man of note has been killed or
wounded. Marshal Lannes had his breast scratched without
being wounded. Marshal Davoust had his hat carried
away and a great number of balls in his clothes." To
Josephine, who was awaiting the results of the campaign
at Mayence, he wrote on October 16th: "Everything
has turned out as I planned, and never was an army more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
thoroughly beaten and destroyed." The Emperor confessed,
that, during the night before the battle of Jena, he
had been exposed to the most imminent danger, and might
have disappeared without anyone knowing clearly his fate.
He had approached the bivouacs of the Prussians in the
dark, to reconnoitre, having only a few officers about his
person. The French army was almost everywhere on the
alert, under a persuasion that the Prussians were strongly
addicted to nocturnal attacks. Returning from that survey,
the Emperor was fired at by the first sentinel of his
own camp, which proved a signal for the whole line; and
he had no resource left but to throw himself flat on his
face until the mistake should be discovered. His principal
apprehension, however, was not realized; he feared
least the Prussian line, then very near him, might act in
the same manner.</p>

<p>When the conflict ended 20,000 Prussians lay dead on
the battle field, or were taken prisoners, including twenty
generals. Among the trophies of war were 300 cannon
and sixty royal standards.</p>

<p>The Queen of Prussia was a fearless horsewoman and
had faced great dangers at Jena. When she rode before
her troops in her helmet of polished steel, shaded by a
plume, in her glittering golden cuirass, her tunic of silver
stuff, her red boots with gold spurs, she resembled Tasso's
heroines. The soldiers burst into cries of enthusiasm as
they saw their warlike queen: before her were bowed the
flags she had embroidered with her own hands and the
old, torn, and battle-stained standards of Frederick the
Great. After the battle she was obliged to take flight,
at full gallop, to avoid being captured by the French
hussars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>The Duke of Brunswick, who had contended with
Napoleon in this memorable engagement, was wounded
in the face with a grape-shot early in the battle and was
carried off the field never to recover.</p>

<p>The various routed divisions roamed about the country
seeking separately a means of escape, and fell an easy
prey to the French. The Prince of Hohenlohe at length
drew together not less than 50,000 of these wandering
soldiers and threw himself at their head into Magdeburg,
but that great fortress had been stripped of all its stores
for the service of the Duke of Brunswick's army before
Jena, and Hohenlohe was compelled to retreat. He was
defeated in a number of skirmishes, and at length, finding
himself devoid of ammunition or provisions, laid down
his arms. The Duke of Wurtemburg, one of the Prussian
generals, had taken a position at Halle and Bernadotte
marched upon him. He attacked the enemy with the
bayonet, killing and routing all who dared oppose him.
The slaughter was dreadful and Napoleon, visiting the
field of battle the ensuing day, was struck with the sight
of the heaps of dead surrounding the bodies of the French
soldiers. Observing on the uniforms some of the buttons
of the 32d, he said with a sigh, "So many of that regiment
were killed in Italy, Egypt, and elsewhere, I
thought none could be remaining."</p>

<p>General Blucher was shortly afterwards compelled to
lay down his arms after a loss of 4,000 men out of 10,000
at Lubeck, where a severe action was fought in the streets
of the town on the 6th of November. The fortresses of
the Prussian monarch now capitulated as fast as their
commanders were requested to do so, and Napoleon
entered Berlin in triumph on the 25th of October. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
honor of taking possession of that city Napoleon reserved
for Davoust's corps, which had contributed so much to
the victory at Jena.</p>

<p>The Prussians could not comprehend the rapid marches
and the promptitude with which they were met in their
flights. As the Emperor said in his 14th bulletin:
"These gentry are doubtless accustomed to the manoeuvres
of the 'Seven Years' War.' They would demand
three days to bury their dead. 'Think of the living'
replied the Emperor, 'and leave the care of interring the
dead to us; there is no need of a truce for that.'"</p>

<p>Thus in a campaign of a week's duration had the proud
Prussian monarchy been leveled to the ground. The
people, believing that the fall of the military meant necessarily
the fall of the monarchy itself, the pride and
strength of the nation disappeared and every bond of union
among the various provinces of the crown seemed to be
at once dissolved.</p>

<p>On the 25th of October, 1806, after passing in review
the Imperial foot guards, commanded by Lefebvre, Napoleon
visited the tomb of Frederick the Great at Potsdam
where were stored a number of mementos of the great
warrior. The court of Prussia had fled with so much
precipitancy from Potsdam, that nothing had been carried
away. Even the sword of Frederick the Great, the belt
and the cordon of his orders, were left there.</p>

<p>On finding that the court had not thought of placing
these relics out of the reach of invasion, the Emperor took
possession of them. As he displayed the sword of Frederick,
he said: "I prefer these trophies to all the King
of Prussia's treasures. I will send them to my veterans
who served in the campaigns of Hanover. I will present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
them to the Governor of the Hospital of the Invalides, who
will preserve them as a testimony of the victories of the
army, and the revenge it has taken for the disasters of
Rosbach."</p>

<p>"The door of the monument was open," says General
Ségur; "Napoleon paused at the entrance in a grave
and respectful attitude. He gazed into the shadow enclosing
the hero's ashes, and stood thus for nearly ten minutes
motionless, silent, as if buried in deep thought. There
were five or six of us with him: Duroc, Caulaincourt,
an aide-de-camp and I. We gazed at this solemn and
extraordinary scene, imagining the two great men face to
face, identifying ourselves with the thoughts we ascribed
to our Emperor before that other genius whose glory survived
the overthrow of his work, who was as great in
extreme adversity as in success."</p>

<p>During his stay at Berlin Napoleon issued the famous
"Berlin Decrees" by which he attempted to establish the
"continental system," whose object was to shut out the
commerce and intercourse of Great Britain from the Continent
of Europe. The ruin of France's maritime power
at Trafalgar, and the almost universal supremacy of the
French Empire on land left Napoleon in his own judgment,
no other means of retaliation. Through this continental
system he endeavored, for several years, to
annihilate all commercial intercourse between the continent
and England.</p>

<p>The Prince of Hatzfeld was detected, during Napoleon's
stay at Berlin, in sending secret information of the state
and movements of the French army to the enemy. One
of his letters fell into the hands of the French and he was
arrested. His wife gained access to Napoleon's apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>ments,
and, ignorant of her husband's conduct, spoke
with the boldness of innocence in his favor. On being
handed the letter written by her husband she was completely
overcome and fell on her knees before the Emperor,
imploring his forgiveness. "Throw that paper into the
fire, madam," said Napoleon, "and the military commission
will then have no proof of his guilt."</p>

<p>With a cry of joy the princess did as she was directed
and the order of arrest, which would have resulted in Hatzfeld's
death in an hour, was recalled.</p>

<p>While at Berlin the Emperor addressed his troops in a
proclamation in which he said: "Our entrance into
Potsdam and Berlin had been preceded by the fame of
our victories. We have made 60,000 prisoners, taken
sixty-five standards, among which are the colors of the
King of Prussia's guards, six hundred pieces of cannon,
and three fortresses. Among the prisoners there are
upwards of twenty generals; yet, notwithstanding all this,
more than half our troops regret their not having fired a
single shot *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Soldiers, the Russians boast of coming
to meet us, but we will advance to encounter, and
save them half their march; they shall meet another
Austerlitz in the heart of Prussia. A nation that can so
soon forget our generous treatment after that battle,&mdash;owed
their safety only to the capitulation we granted them,&mdash;is a
power that cannot successfully contend against us. We
will not again be the dupes of a treacherous peace."</p>

<p>Before leaving Berlin Napoleon received a deputation of
the Senate, sent from Paris to congratulate him on the
success of his campaign. Accompanied by representatives
from the army, he made them the bearer of the trophies
of his recent victories. He then prepared to extinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
whatever resistance existed in a few garrisons of the Prussian
monarchy and to meet, before they could reach the
soil of Germany, those Russians who were now advancing,
too late, to the assistance of Frederic William.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="VII" id="VII">VII</a><br />

THE BATTLE OF EYLAU</h2>

<p class="p2">Before opening the great campaign with Russia Napoleon
received the explanation of the Elector of Saxony,
who truly stated that Prussia had forced him to take part
in the war. The apology was accepted, and from this
time the Elector adhered to the league of the Rhine and
was a faithful ally of Napoleon. On November 25th, 1806,
the Emperor of France left Berlin and established himself
on the 27th at Posen, a central town of Poland, which
country began to manifest an agitation arising from the
animating prospect of restored independence. The
unfortunate but brave Poles entreated his aid; but Napoleon
could not make them a positive promise of their
restoration as a kingdom. His observation on the subject
was, "that, if the match should once be lighted, there was
no knowing how long it might continue to burn."</p>

<p>From the headquarters at Posen, Napoleon addressed
his soldiers on December 2nd, saying: "It is a year
ago to-day, at this very hour, that you were on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
battlefield of Austerlitz. The dismayed Russian battalions
fled in disorder, or, surrounded, gave up their arms
to their victors. The next day they sued for peace, but
we were imposed on: scarcely escaped by our, perhaps,
overweening generosity, from the disasters of a third coalition,
they ventured upon a fourth.... Soldiers, we
will not lay down our arms until the general peace shall
have fixed and assured the power of our allies and restored
to our commerce its safety and its colonies." The proclamation
produced an exhilarating effect on the soldiers
and throughout Germany.</p>

<p>In the meantime Warsaw was put in a state of defense,
and the auxiliary forces of Saxony and the new confederates
of the Rhine were brought up by forced marches,
while strong reinforcements from France repaired the
losses of the early part of the campaign.</p>

<p>The French army at length advanced in full force and
crossed successively the rivers Vistula, the Narew and Bug,
forcing a passage wherever it was disputed, the Russian
detachments being repulsed as often as they presented themselves.
But it was not the intention of Bennigsen, the
Russian general, to give battle to forces superior to his
own, and he therefore retreated behind the Wkra. On
the 23rd of December Napoleon arrived in person upon
the Wkra and ordered the advance of his army in three
divisions. He was fully aware that he was approaching
a conflict of a very different kind from that which he had
maintained with Austria, and more lately against Prussia.
These troops, however highly disciplined, wanted that
powerful and individual feeling which was a strong characteristic
of the Russians,&mdash;a feeling that induces the soldier
to resist to the last moment, even when resistance can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
only assure him of revenge. They were, in fact, those same
Russians of whom Frederick the Great said, "that he
could kill, but could not defeat them." They were also
of strong constitution and inured to the iron climate in
which Frenchmen were now fighting for the first time.
The Cossacks are trained from early childhood to the use
of the lance and sword, and familiarized to a horse peculiar
to the country,&mdash;tractable, hardy, swift and sure-footed,
beyond any breed perhaps in the world. On the actual
field of battle the Cossack's mode of attack is singular;
instead of acting in line, a body of them about to charge
disperse at the word of command, and joining in a loud
yell and hurrah, each acting individually upon the object
of attack, whether infantry, cavalry or artillery, to all of
which they have been in this wild way of fighting most
formidable assailants.</p>

<p>In this campaign the Cossacks took the field in great
numbers, under their celebrated hetman Platoff. The Russians
also had in their service Tartar tribes who resemble
the Cossacks in warfare; but they were little better than
hordes of roving savages. On the plain between the town
of Pultusk and the wood the right of the Russian position
was formed, and on December 26th they were attacked
by the French division of Lannes and Davoust with but
partial success. The French lost nearly 8,000 men, killed
and wounded, while the Russian loss amounted to about
5,000. The French retreated after nightfall. On the
same day another division engaged in action at Golymin,
driving back the French after which the Russian commander
retreated for the purpose of concentrating his
forces with the Grand Army. Both engagements were
without immediate results, and instead of pressing their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
operations, the French retreated into winter quarters, Napoleon
withdrawing his guard as far as Warsaw, while the
other divisions were cantoned in the towns to the eastward.</p>

<p>Bennigsen was now placed in supreme command of
the Russian forces, amounting to 90,000 men, and he at
once resolved not to wait for Napoleon's onset, but chose
rather to anticipate him, wisely concluding that his enemy's
desire of desisting from active operation, as evinced by
cantoning his troops in winter quarters, ought to be a
signal to the Russians to again take the field. Thus the
French Emperor found himself forced into a winter campaign,
and he at once issued general orders for drawing out
his forces for the purpose of concentrating them at Willenberg,
in the rear of the Russians, who were then stationed at
Mohringen. The duration of the winter quarters, in which
the French troops had been placed, lasted no longer than
the weather would permit. The army reposed almost
the whole of the month of December, and towards the
beginning of January 1807, movements on both sides
seemed to indicate more serious operations. It appeared
the Russians had adopted a vast plan of defense. Their
generals seemed to have regained confidence, on seeing
Napoleon stop amidst the advantages he had acquired, and
imputed that to fear which arose in him from motives of
prudence. They could not imagine what other reason he
could possibly have for going into cantonments upon the
Vistula.</p>

<p>Napoleon now proposed to force his enemies eastward
towards the Vistula, as at Jena he had compelled the
Prussians to fight with their rear turned to the Rhine.
Bernadotte had orders to engage the attention of Bennigsen
upon the right, and detain him in his present situation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
or rather, if possible, to induce him to advance eastward
so as to facilitate the operations he meditated.</p>

<p>The Russian commander learned Bonaparte's intention
from an intercepted dispatch, and changed his purpose of
advancing on Ney and Bernadotte. Marches and counter-marches
took place, through a country at all times difficult,
and now covered with snow. Bennigsen was aware that it
was to his advantage to protract the campaign in this
manner, as he was near his reinforcements, and the French
were distant from theirs:&mdash;every loss therefore telling more
in proportion to the enemy than to his own army.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this apparent advantage, the distress
of the Russian army was so extreme from the lack of suitable
provisions that it induced General Bennigsen, against
his judgment, to give battle at all risks, and for this purpose
to concentrate his forces at Preuss-Eylau, which was
decided upon as the field which he proposed to contest
with Napoleon.</p>

<p>It had been the intention to maintain the town itself
which Bennigsen had entered on the 7th of February, and
a body of troops had been left for that purpose; but in
the confusion attending the movement of so large an army,
the orders had been misunderstood, and the division
designed for this service evacuated the place as soon as
the rear-guard had passed through it. A Russian division
was hastily ordered to re-occupy the town; but they found
the French already in possession, and although they dislodged
them, they were themselves driven out in turn by
another division of French to whom Napoleon had promised
unusual rewards. A third division of Russians now
advanced, Bennigsen being desirous of protracting the
contest for the town until the arrival of his heavy artillery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
which joined him by a different route. When it came up
he would have discontinued the struggle for Eylau but it
was impossible to control the ardor of the Russian columns
who persevered in advancing, with drums beating, rushed
into the town and surprised the French in the act of sacking
it,&mdash;putting many of them to death by the bayonet.</p>

</div>

<p>Another division of the French now advanced under
cover of the hillocks and broken ground which skirt the
village, threw their fire upon the streets and the Russians
once more retreated with considerable loss. The town
was now once more and finally occupied by the French.
Night fell and the combat ceased only to be renewed with
increased fury the next day.</p>

<p>The Russians occupied a space of uneven ground, about
two miles in length and a mile in depth, with the village
of Serpallen on their left. In the front of their army lay
the town of Preuss-Eylau, situated in a hollow and in possession
of the French. The latter occupied Eylau with
their left, while their centre and right lay parallel to the
Russians, upon a chain of heights which commanded, in
a great measure, the ground possessed by the enemy.
The French also expected to be reinforced by Ney's division
which had not yet come up, and which was destined
to form on the extreme left. The space between the
hostile armies was open and flat, covered with snow and
intersected with frozen lakes. The soldiers could trace
each other's positions by the pale glimmer of watch lights
upon the snow.</p>

<p>Napoleon, who slept but three or four hours that night
in a chair in the postmaster's house, placed the corps
of Marshal Soult at Eylau itself, partly within the town,
partly on the right and left of it, Augereau's corps and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the Imperial Guard a little in the rear, and all the cavalry
upon the wings till daylight should enable him to make
his final disposition of the fifty odd thousand men, exclusive
of Ney's corps, and which were to meet the ninety
thousand Russians and Prussians.</p>

<p>At daybreak on the 8th of February, 1807, two strong
columns of the French advanced for the purpose of turning
the right and storming the centre of the Russians, who
had commenced the firing at one and the same time;
but they were driven back in great disorder by the heavy
and sustained fire of the Russian artillery. An attack on
the enemy's left was equally unsuccessful. The Russian
infantry stood like stone ramparts, each time repulsing the
French assault&mdash;their cavalry then came to the support,
pursued the retiring assailants and took standards and
eagles.</p>

<p>About mid-day a heavy snowstorm set in, which
the wind drove right in the faces of the Russians, adding
to the obscurity caused by the smoke of the burning village
of Serpallen that rolled along the line. The snow
having now ceased, a melancholy spectacle presented
itself. Thousands of dead and wounded lay on the ground,
and several of the divisions were still hors de combat.
Augereau's two divisions had been swept down by an
unmasked battery of seventy-two pieces, and Augereau,
wounded himself, but more affected by the disaster of his
corps than by his personal danger, was carried to the
cemetery of Eylau to the feet of Napoleon. To the Emperor
he complained, not without bitterness, of the failure to
send him timely succor. Silent grief pervaded every face
in the imperial staff. Napoleon, calm and firm, addressed
a few soothing words to Augereau, then sent him to the
rear, and took measures for repairing the mischief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Dispatching in the first place the chasseurs of the Guard
and some squadrons of dragoons which were at hand, he
sent for Murat and ordered him to make a decisive effort
on the line of the infantry which formed the centre of the
Russian army, and which, taking advantage of Augereau's
disaster began to press forward. At the first summons
Murat came up at a gallop: "Well," said Napoleon,
"are you going to let those fellows eat us up?" He then
ordered the heroic chief of his cavalry to collect the chasseurs,
the dragoons, the cuirassiers, and to fall upon the
Russians with eighty squadrons, to see what effect such a
mass of horse, charging furiously, would have on an infantry
reputed not to be shaken. The cavalry of the
Guard was brought forward ready to add its shock to that
of the cavalry of the army.</p>

<p>The moment was critical, for if the Russian infantry
were not stopped it would soon attack the cemetery, the
centre of the French position, and Napoleon had but six
foot battalions of the Imperial Guard to defend it. Murat
galloped off, collected his squadrons, made them pass
between the cemetery and Rothenen where Augereau's
corps had marched to almost certain destruction. Charge
after charge was made and successfully resisted. At
length one of them, rushing on with more violence, broke
the enemy's infantry at one point and opened the breach
through which cuirassiers and dragoons rushed, each eager
to penetrate first. The Russians' first and second lines
being broken, they turned the batteries of their artillery
on the confused mass, killing as many of their own soldiers
as those of the French, not caring whether they
killed friends or foes so that they got rid of the formidable
French force; but their efforts were useless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Napoleon, graver than usual, in a gray riding-coat and
Polish cap, sat motionless in the cemetery, in which were
heaped bodies of a great number of his officers; his Guard
was behind him and before him the chasseurs, the
dragoons, the cuirassiers; they formed anew and were
ready to devote themselves as he might direct. The
Emperor waited long before determining definitely on
his last attack. Never had he nor his soldiers been engaged
in such a hotly contested fight. The bullets whistled around
and a shell burst within a few paces of him. Augereau's
arm was broken and Lannes was wounded but not
severely.</p>

<p>Under cover of darkness six columns of the French now
advanced with artillery and cavalry and were close on the
Russian position ere they were opposed. Bennigsen, at
the head of his staff, brought up the reserve in position,
and, on uniting with the first line bore the French back
at the point of the bayonet. Their columns, partly broken,
were driven again to their own position where they rallied
with difficulty. A French regiment of cuirassiers, which
during this part of the action had made an opening in the
Russian line, were charged by the Cossacks, and found
their defensive armor no protection against the lance. All
but eighteen were slain.</p>

<p>At the moment when the Russians appeared to be the
victors Davoust's division, which had been manoeuvring
since the beginning of the action to turn the left and gain
the rear of the Russian line, now made its appearance
on the field. The effect was sudden and demoralizing to
the Russians; Serpallen was lost, the Russian left wing,
and a portion of its centre were thrown into disorder,
and forced to retire and change front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>At this point in the contest the Prussian reinforcements,
long expected, appeared in turn suddenly on the
field, and passing the left of the French and right of the
Russians, pushed down in three columns to redeem the
battle on the Russian centre and rear. The Prussians,
under their gallant leader L'Estocq, never fired until
within a few paces of the enemy and then used the bayonet
with fearful effect. They redeemed the ground
which the Russians had lost and drove back in their turn
the troops of Davoust and Bernadotte who had lately been
victorious. Ney, in the meantime appeared on the field
with his advanced guard and occupied Schnaditten, a village
on the road to Konigsberg. As this endangered the
communication of the Russians with that town, it was
thought necessary to carry it by storm; a resolution which
was successfully executed, the enemy's rear-guard retreating
in disorder.</p>

<p>This was the last act of that bloody day at Eylau. It
was ten o' clock at night and darkness put an end to the
combat. After fourteen hours of fighting both armies
occupied the same positions taken in the morning. It was
in fact the longest and by far the severest battle Napoleon
had yet been engaged in. At the beginning of the contest,
Augereau was scarcely in his senses, from the severity
of rheumatic pain to which he was subject; but the sound
of the cannon awakens the brave: he flew at full gallop
at the head of his corps, after causing himself to be tied
to his horse! He was constantly exposed to the hottest
of the fire, and was only slightly wounded.</p>

<p>A few days after the battle Napoleon sent to Paris
sixteen stands of colors taken on that occasion and ordered
the cannon to be melted down and made into a statue of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
General d' Haulpoult, in the uniform of his regiment,
he having gallantly commanded the second division of
cuirassiers, when he was killed in the action.</p>

<p>In three letters which the Emperor wrote to Josephine
during the month of February he alluded with the deepest
affection to the horrors of this engagement. "We had
yesterday," he said, "a great battle. The victory was
mine, but I have been deprived of a great many men.
The loss of the enemy, still more considerable, does not
console me." "The land is covered with dead and
wounded," he adds in a second letter; "This is not
the noble portion of war. One is pained, and the soul is
oppressed at the sight of so many victims."</p>

<p>In the biting frost, in face of thousands of dead and dying,
when the gloomy day was sinking into a night of anguish,
the Emperor had said: "This sight is one to fill rulers
with a love of peace and a horror of war," and in his
bulletin of the engagement he said: "Imagine, on a
space of a league square, nine or ten thousand corpses,
four or five thousand dead horses, lines of Russian knapsacks,
fragments of guns and sabres; the earth covered
with bullets, shells, supplies; twenty-four cannon, surrounded
by their artillerymen, slain just as they were
trying to take their guns away; and all that in plainest
relief on the stretch of snow!"</p>

<p>Twelve of Napoleon's eagles were in the hands of the
Russians, and the field between them was covered with
50,000 corpses, of whom at least half were French. Each
leader claimed the victory. The Russians retired from
Eylau towards Konigsberg the very night after the battle,
and the French made no effort to pursue but remained on
the field nine days to allow the troops some repose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in truth a drawn battle. The point of superiority
on this dreadful day would have been hard to decide, but
the victory, if rightly claimed by either party, must be pronounced
to have remained with Napoleon; for Bennigsen
retreated and left him master of the field of battle where he
slept and remained for days; but it was a ghastly triumph.
During the whole time the contest lasted Napoleon's countenance
was never observed to change; nor did he show
any emotion whatever; but all accounts agree that he was
deeply impressed with the horrors of the succeeding
night.</p>

<p>Finally, on the 19th of February, Napoleon left Eylau
and retreated with his whole army to Osterode on the
Vistula. Here he established his headquarters, living in
a sort of barn, governing his Empire and controlling
Europe. The doubtful issue of the battle of Eylau
had given a shock to public opinion and it required all the
Emperor's prudence and address to overcome it. Great
despondency was produced in Paris by the bulletin of the
battle and a marked depression took place in the funds.</p>

FRIEDLAND AND PEACE OF TILSIT</h2>

<p class="p2">Napoleon soon decided that it would be fatal rashness
to engage in another campaign in Poland while several
fortified towns, and above all, Dantzic, held out in his
rear. He determined to capture all these places and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
summon new forces from France before again meeting
in the field such enemies as the Russians had proved
themselves to be.</p>

<p>Dantzic was at length compelled to surrender on May
7th 1807, Marshal Lefebvre receiving the title of Duke of
Dantzic in commemoration of his important success,
after which event Napoleon's extraordinary exertions in
hurrying supplies from France, Switzerland and the
Rhine country, and the addition of the division of 25,000
men which had captured Dantzic, enabled him to take
the field again by the first of June at the head of not less
than 280,000 men. The Russian general had also done
all in his power to recruit his army which was now reinforced
by 90,000 men, during this interval.</p>

<p>The Russians were in the field by the 5th of June and were
the first assailants; but nothing but skirmishes resulted until
the Russian army was forced to retire towards Heilsberg
where they halted, and there concentrating their forces,
made a most desperate stand. They were, however,
overpowered by superior numbers, after maintaining their
position during a whole day. The battle had continued
until midnight upon terms of equality, and when the
morning dawned the space between the Russians and
French was literally sheeted over with the bodies of the
dead and wounded.</p>

<p>The Russians retired after the battle, crossing the river
Aller, and on the 13th of June reached Friedland, a town
of some importance on the west side of the stream, communicating
with the eastern, or right bank of the river by
a long wooden bridge. It was the intention of Napoleon
to induce the Russian general to pass by this narrow bridge
by the left bank, and then to decoy him into a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
action, in a position where the general difficulty of defiling
through the town, and over the bridge, must render
retreat almost impossible. For this purpose he showed
only such portion of his forces as induced General Bennigsen
to believe that the French troops on the western
side of the Aller consisted only of Oudinot's division,
which had been severely handled in the battle of Heilsberg,
and which he now hoped to altogether destroy.
Under this deception Bennigsen ordered a Russian division
to pass the bridge, defile through the town and march to the
assault. The French took great care to offer no such
resistance as would show their real strength, and Bennigsen
supposing he had only a single division of the French
army before him, and forgetting the usual promptitude
of combination for which Napoleon was distinguished, had
pushed on and brought an action which he believed he
could terminate quickly and triumphantly. He was soon
led to reinforce this first division with another. This was
followed by other still divisions, and as the engagement was
now becoming heated the Russian general at length transported
all his army, one division excepted, to the left
bank of the Aller, by means of the wooden bridge and
three pontoons, and arrayed them in front of the town of
Friedland, to overpower, as he supposed, the crippled
division of the French to which alone he believed himself
exposed. But no sooner had he taken this irretrievable
step than the mask was dropped.</p>

<p>Napoleon was at first unable to believe that Bennigsen
would venture to leave any part of his army for any period
in so perilous a position as that in which he had placed it,
maintaining a doubtful combat with no means of retreat
but through the entanglement of the town of Friedland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and across the long narrow bridge of the Aller. His
astonishment was great, therefore, when he learned from
the officers he sent to reconnoitre that the whole Russian
army was crossing the bridge, with the exception of one
small division, and forming in front of the town. He
had secured a victory by his numbers and position, but
his remark to Savary, who carried him the information of
the Russian movement, was characteristic, "Well," said
he, "I am ready now, I have an hour's advantage of them,
and will give them the battle, since they wish for it."</p>

<p>The French skirmishers advanced in force, heavy columns
of infantry began to show themselves, batteries of cannon
were placed in position, and Bennigsen found himself in
the presence of the whole French army. His position, a
sort of plain surrounded by woods and broken ground,
was difficult to defend; with the town and a large river in
the rear it was dangerous to attempt a retreat, and an
advance was prevented by the inequality of his force.
Bennigsen found it expedient to detach 6,000 men to
defend the bridge at Allerberg, some six miles from Friedland
on the Aller, and with the rest of his forces he
resolved to maintain his present position until night,
hoping for Prussian reinforcements from General L'Estocq,
via the town of Wehlau.</p>

<p>At about 10 o'clock on the morning of the 14th
the French advanced to the attack. "This is the
14th of June; it will be a fortunate day for us," said
Napoleon, recurring to the most glorious day of his life;
"it is the anniversary of the battle of Marengo." The
broken and wooded country which the French occupied
enabled them to maintain and renew their efforts at pleasure,
while the Russians in their exposed position could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
not make the slightest movement without being observed.
At about noon the French seemed to be sickening of the
contest and about to retire. This, however, was only a
feint to give repose to such of the forces as had been
engaged, and to bring up reinforcements. The cannonading
continued until after 4 o'clock, the Russian line
having sustained charge after charge and had neither
recoiled or broken before infantry or cavalry. Napoleon,
from his point of observation near the battlefield, had
witnessed the failure of every strategem and the charge
of every division, and at last finding the day waning, drew
up his full force in person for the purpose of making one
of those desperate and generally irrisistible efforts to which
he often resorted to force a decision of a doubtful day.</p>

<p>There was not a marshal in his Empire under whom the
troops would not behave gallantly, but when the Emperor
put himself at the head of his army and led them to the
charge, nothing could resist the shock. The brave
Oudinot, hastening up with coat perforated by balls, and
his horse covered with blood, exclaimed to the Emperor:
"Make haste, sire, give me a reinforcement, and I will
drive all the Russians into the water!" The day was far
advanced, and some of Napoleon's lieutenants were of the
opinion that they ought to defer the final and decisive
movement till the morrow. "No! No!" replied Napoleon.
"One does not catch an enemy twice in such a
scrape." He then made his disposition of the several
corps for the final attack.</p>

<p>Surrounded by his lieutenants, he explained to them,
with energy and precision, the part which each of them
had to act. Grasping the arm of Marshal Ney, and
pointing to Friedland, the bridges, the Russians crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
together in front, he said: "Yonder is the goal,
march to it without looking about you; break into that
thick mass whatever it costs you; enter Friedland, take
the bridges, and give yourself no concern about
what may happen on your right, on your left or on your
rear. The army and I shall be there to attend to that."</p>

<p>Ney at once set out at a gallop to accomplish the formidable
task. Struck with his martial attitude Napoleon,
addressing Marshal Mortier, said with much satisfaction:
"That man is a lion!"</p>

<p>The order for attack all along the line with cavalry, infantry
and artillery was now given, and simultaneously the
Russians began to yield, the French advancing at the same
time with shouts of assured victory. The Russians were
now obliged to retreat in front of the enemy, and in half
an hour the rout was complete. In vain did the enemy
make all their reserves advance; Friedland was at last carried,
but in the midst of a horrible carnage. The enemy
left 20,000 men on the field, of whom 15,000 were killed
and 5,000 wounded, and among the number thirty
generals.</p>

<p>Dupont, who had been sent to assist Ney, met him in the
heart of Friedland, then in flames, and they congratulated
one another on the glorious success: Ney had continued to
march straight forward, and Napoleon, placed in the centre
of the divisions which he kept in reserve, had never ceased
to watch his progress. It was now half past ten at
night. Napoleon in his vast career had not gained a
more splendid victory. He had for trophies eighty pieces
of cannon, few prisoners, it is true, for the Russians chose
rather to drown themselves than surrender. Twenty-five
thousand Russians were killed as against 8,000 French.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Out of 80,000 French 25,000 had not fired a shot. Meanwhile
the bridge and pontoons were set on fire to prevent
the French who had forced their way into the town, from
taking possession of them. The smoke rolling over the
scene increased the horror of the surroundings.</p>

<p>The Russian centre and right, which remained on the
west side of the Aller, effected a retreat by a circuitous
route, leaving on the right the town of Friedland with
its burning bridges no longer practicable for friend or foe,
and passed the Aller by a ford found in the very moment
of extremity further down the river. Napoleon sent no
cavalry in pursuit, though he had forty squadrons who
might have cut them to pieces. Many animadversions
have been cast upon him for not improving his victory in
this manner; but the reason appeared clear: his object
was to make peace with the Emperor Alexander, and the
butchery of the broken battalions of the Russian guard
would in no way have forwarded that object, and no power
remained to oppose itself to the immense force under
France's victorious warrior.</p>

<p>Thus ended the great battle of Friedland. "My children,"
wrote Napoleon to Josephine, "have worthily
celebrated the battle of Marengo. The battle of Friedland
will be equally celebrated and glorious for my people....
It is a worthy sister of Marengo, Austerlitz and
Jena."</p>

<p>Napoleon visited the battlefield the next morning and
beheld a frightful spectacle. The order of the Russian
squares could be traced by a line of heaps of slain; and the
position of their artillery might be guessed by the dead
horses. As Savary well says: "It might be truly said
that sovereigns ought to have great interests of their
subjects at stake to justify such dreadful sacrifices."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>The Emperor Alexander, overawed by the genius of
Napoleon which had triumphed over troops more resolute
than had ever before opposed him, and alarmed for the
consequences of some decisive measure towards the reorganization
of the Poles as a nation, began to think
seriously of peace. On the 21st of June General Bennigsen
asked for an armistice and to this the victor of Friedland
gave an immediate assent on his arrival at Tilsit. On
the 22nd of June a proclamation was addressed by Napoleon
to his army in which he said; "From the banks of
the Vistula, we have arrived upon those of the Niemen
with the rapidity of the eagle's flight. You celebrated at
Austerlitz, the anniversary of the coronation, and you
have this year celebrated, in an appropriate manner, the
battle of Marengo, which put a period to the second coalition.
Frenchmen, you have proved worthy of yourselves
and me. You will return to France covered with laurels
after having obtained a glorious peace, which carries with
it the guarantee for its duration."</p>

<p>It was known that the Emperor Alexander was on the
other side of the Niemen, at a village not far distant, and
Napoleon addressed his reply to the sovereign in person.
Its purport was to the effect that he was quite ready to
make peace but would not consent to an armistice, if war
were to continue. The result was a proposal on the part
of Alexander that an interview should take place between
the Emperor of France and himself, which was accepted.
The armistice was ratified on the 23rd of June and on the
25th the Emperors of France and Russia met personally,
each accompanied by a few attendants, on a raft moored
midstream in the river Niemen, near Tilsit, the
town which gave its name to the secret treaty agreed upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
at this time. The sovereigns embraced as they met, with
their armies on the two banks of the river and retiring
under a canopy, amid the cheers of the troops, had a long
conversation, to which no one was a witness.</p>

<p>At its termination the appearance of mutual good will
and confidence was marked, and the two Emperors
established their courts there and lived together, in the
midst of the lately hostile armies, more like old friends
than enemies and rivals, attempting by diplomatic means
the arrangement of differences which had for years been
deluging Europe with blood. By this treaty the King of
Prussia was admitted as a party, Napoleon restoring to
Frederick William ancient Prussia and the French conquests
in Upper Saxony,&mdash;the king agreeing to adopt
the "Continental System."</p>

<p>The beautiful and fascinating Queen of Prussia also
arrived at Tilsit, but too late to obtain more favorable terms
for her country than had already been granted her husband.
"Forgive us," she said, as Napoleon received her,
"forgive us this fatal war; the memory of the great
Frederick deceived us; we thought ourselves his equal
because we are his descendants; alas! we have not proved
such!"</p>

<p>The Queen used every strategem which wit and genius
could devise, and every fascination to which beauty could
lend a charm, but without avail. Foiled in her ambition
she died soon after, it is said, of chagrin.</p>

<p>No single episode in the career of Napoleon Bonaparte
has been more adversely commented on than his alleged
breach of faith with the Queen of Prussia, when the
domain of her husband was absolutely at his feet. He
always denied that he had broken his word, and according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
to his own story, as told after his final retirement, the
Queen had no cause of complaint.</p>

<p>"The Queen of Prussia was still a beautiful woman,"
he said, "but she had lost many of the charms of youth.
She evidently expected to use her powers of persuasion on
me for the benefit of Prussia. At dinner I took a beautiful
rose from the table and presented it to her. She took it,
smiled sweetly, and exclaimed: 'At least with Magdeburg,
I hope.' I answered: 'Your majesty will observe that I
am doing the giving and you are receiving what I give.'</p>

<p>"I hastened the preparations for the completion of the
treaty, and it was signed. When the Queen learned that
Magdeburg had not been given to Prussia she was very
angry. She went to the Czar Alexander, and said, with
tears in her eyes: 'That man has broken his word with
me.' 'Oh, no!' the Czar answered. 'I can hardly think
that. I believe I have been present on every occasion
when you have met Napoleon, and I have listened more
carefully than you have thought. But, if you can prove
to me that he made any promise that he has not kept, I
pledge you my word as a man I will see that he keeps it.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, but he gave me to understand&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'That is precisely the point,' responded the Czar.
'He has promised nothing.' The Queen turned quickly
and left the apartment. She was too proud to acknowledge
that in her effort to outwit me she had been outwitted."</p>

<p>At a subsequent meeting with Napoleon the Queen
said, "Is it possible, that, after having the honor of being
so near the hero of the century and of history, he will not
leave me the power and satisfaction of being enabled to
assure him he has attached me to him for life?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"Madam" replied the Emperor, in a serious tone, "I
am to be pitied; it is the result of my unhappy stars."
He then took leave of the Queen, who, on reaching her
carriage, threw herself on the seat in tears.</p>

<p>Alexander was charmed by the presence of Napoleon.
They spent some days at Tilsit together, and never did he
leave the French Emperor without expressing his unbounded
admiration of him. "What a great man," he
said incessantly to those who approached him; "What a
genius! What extensive views! What a captain!
What a statesman! Had I but known him sooner how
many faults he might have spared me! What great
things we might have accomplished together!"</p>

<p>In July Napoleon hastened back to Paris, arriving there
on the 27th. He was received by the Senate and other
public bodies as well as by the people with demonstrations
similar to those which had been shown him on his return
from the victory at Austerlitz. Fêtes and celebrations in
honor of his achievements dazzled the world. He had
now wrung from the last of his reluctant enemies, except
England, the recognition of his imperial power, which
already embraced a wider territory and a far greater
number of subjects than Charlemagne ruled over, as Emperor
of the West, a thousand years before. The power
of Napoleon, the prosperity of France, and the splendor of
Paris may be said to have been at their greatest height at
this period. The regulation of the whole Empire lay in
the hand of Napoleon himself, and as the glory of France
had always been, and continued to be his grand object,
every faculty of his intellect was bent to its promotion.</p>

<p>"I am inclined to think that I was happiest at Tilsit,"
said Napoleon one day to Gourgaud at St. Helena on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
being asked at what time he was happiest. "I had experienced
vicissitudes, cares, and reverses," he continued,
"Eylau had reminded me that fortune might abandon
me, and I found myself victorious, dictating peace, with
emperors and kings to form my court. After all that is
not a real enjoyment. Perhaps I was really more happy
after my Italian victories hearing the people raise their
voices, only to bless their liberator, and all that at twenty-five
years of age! From that time I saw what I might
become, I already saw the world flying beneath me, as if
I had been carried through the air."</p>

<p>Napier, the eminent historian, and himself an actor in
many of the scenes he describes, says: "Up to the peace
of Tilsit, the wars of France were essentially defensive;
for the bloody contest that wasted the Continent so many
years was not a struggle for pre-eminence between ambitious
powers&mdash;not a dispute for some acquisition of territory&mdash;nor
for the political ascendancy of one or another
nation&mdash;but a deadly conflict to determine whether aristocracy
or democracy should predominate&mdash;whether aristocracy
or privilege should henceforth be the principle of
European governments."</p>

<p>On the 15th of August the Emperor repaired in great
pomp to Notre Dame, where the Te Deum was sung and
thanksgiving offered up for the peace of Tilsit&mdash;a peace
that gave much glory to France, but which as has generally
been conceded, was "poor politics"; but, as Thiers
has well said: "In war Napoleon was guided by his
genius, in politics by his passions."</p>

WAR WITH SPAIN</h2>

<p class="p2">At the signing of the treaty of Tilsit Napoleon had
attained an eminence which, had his career ended at that
time, would have left him a name revered by all the world&mdash;except,
perhaps, it be by those enemies whom he had
defeated on the field of battle. His star of destiny, however,
was soon to be dimmed by acts which he ever afterwards
regretted, and which, as he himself more than once
declared, were the means to the end which finally caused
his decline and fall.</p>

<p>Napoleon now turned his attention to Spain, where
scenes shocking to morality were being enacted under the
protection of Charles IV., the old and imbecile Bourbon
king, in order, as he then believed, to insure the success
of his "continental system." Ferdinand, the crown
prince, had formed a party against his father and was
attempting to dethrone him, while murderous courtiers
filled the halls of the royal palace of Madrid, and dictated
laws to the crumbling monarchy.</p>

<p>The vast extent to which the prohibited articles
and colonial manufactures of England found their way
into the Spanish peninsula, and especially into Portugal,
and thence through the hands of whole legions of audacious
smugglers into France itself, had fixed the attention
of Napoleon, who was exasperated at the violation of his
"Berlin decrees" against the continental traffic with England.
In truth, a proclamation issued at Madrid shortly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
before the battle of Jena, and suddenly recalled on the
intelligence of that great victory, had prepared the Emperor
to regard with keen suspicion the conduct of the
Spanish court, and to trace every violation of his system
to its deliberate and hostile connivance. Napoleon knew
that the Spanish cabinet, like that of Austria, was ready
to declare itself the ally of Russia, Prussia and England,
when the battle of Jena came to deceive the hopes of the
coalition. The last hour of the ancient regime was at
hand beyond the Pyrenees; Napoleon felt himself called
upon to give the signal to sound the fearful knell of its
interment.</p>

<p>A treaty was ratified at Fontainebleau on the 29th of
October 1807 between France and Spain, providing for the
immediate invasion of Portugal by a force of 28,000 French
soldiers, under the orders of Junot, and of 27,000 Spaniards;
while a reserve of 40,000 French troops were to be
assembled at Bayonne ready to take the field by the end
of November, in case England should lend an army for
the defense of Portugal, or the people of that country
meet Junot by a national insurrection. Junot forthwith
commenced his march through Spain, where the French
soldiery were everywhere received with coldness and
suspicion, but nowhere by any hostile movement of the
people. He arrived in Portugal, on a peremptory order
from Napoleon, late in November. The contingent of
Spaniards arrived there also, and placed themselves under
Junot's command.</p>

<p>On November 29th, and but a few hours before Junot
made his appearance at the gates of Lisbon, the prince-regent
fled precipitately and sailed for the Brazils. The
disgust of the Portugese at this cowardly act was eminently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
useful to the invaders, and with the exception of one
trivial insurrection, when the conqueror took down the
Portugese arms and set up those of Napoleon in their
place, several months passed in apparent tranquility.
"The House of the Braganza (Bourbon's), had ceased to
reign," as announced in the "Moniteur" at Paris.</p>

<p>Napoleon thus saw Portugal in his grasp; but he had
all along considered it as a place of minor importance, and
availing himself of the treaty of Fontainebleau,&mdash;although
there had been no insurrection of the Portugese, he ordered
his army of 40,000 men, named in the treaty, to proceed
slowly but steadily into the heart of Spain and, without
opposition. The royal family quietly acquiesced in this
movement for some months, being apparently much more
interested in its own petty conspiracies and domestic broils.
A sudden panic at length seized the king and his minister,
who prepared for flight. On the 18th of March, 1808, the
house of Godoy, the court favorite, was sacked by the
populace, Godoy himself assaulted, and his life saved
with extreme difficulty by the royal guards, who placed
him under arrest. At this Charles IV. abdicated his
throne in terror, and on the 20th of March Ferdinand his
son was proclaimed king at Madrid amid a tumult of popular
applause.</p>

<p>Murat had, ere this, assumed command of all the French
troops in Spain, and hearing of the extremities to which
the court factions had gone, he now moved rapidly on
Madrid, surrounded the capital with 30,000 troops and
on the 23rd of March took possession of it in person at the
head of 10,000 more. Charles IV., meanwhile, dispatched
messengers both to Napoleon and to Murat asserting that
his abdication had been involuntary, and invoking their
assistance against his son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Ferdinand entered Madrid on the 24th, found the
French general in command of the capital, and in vain
claimed his recognition as king. Napoleon heard with
regret of the action of Murat, who had risked arousing
the pride and anger of the Spaniards. He therefore sent
Savary, in whose practiced skill he hoped to find a remedy
for the military rashness of Murat, and who was to assume
the chief direction of affairs at Madrid.</p>

<p>Ferdinand was at length persuaded by Savary that his
best chance of securing the aid and protection of Napoleon
lay in meeting him on his way to the Spanish capital
and strive to gain his ear before the emissaries of Godoy
should be able to make an impression concerning Charles'
rights. Ferdinand, therefore, took his departure, and
passing the frontier, arrived at Bayonne on the 20th of
April where he was received by Napoleon with courtesy. In
the evening he was informed by Savary, who had accompanied
him, that his doom was sealed,&mdash;"that the Bourbon
dynasty had ceased to reign in Spain," and that his personal
safety must depend on the readiness with which he
should resign all his pretensions into the hands of
Napoleon.</p>

<p>Murat was now directed to employ means to have the
old king and queen repair also to Bayonne, which they
did, arriving there on May 4th. Following a bitter family
quarrel, Charles IV. resigned the crown of Spain for himself
and his heirs, accepting in return from the hands of
Napoleon a safe retreat in Italy and a splendid mansion.
At the first interview Charles IV. and his son were irrevocably
judged. "When I beheld them at my feet," Napoleon
said later, "and could judge of all their
incapacity, I took pity on the fate of a great nation; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
seized the only opportunity which fortune presented me
with, for regenerating Spain, separating her from England
and closely uniting her with our system." A few days
afterward Ferdinand VII. followed the example of his
father and executed a similar act of resignation.</p>

<p>A suspicion that France meditated the destruction of the
national independence in Spain now began to spread, and
on the 2nd of May when Don Antonio, president of the
Council of Regency at Madrid, and uncle of Ferdinand,
began preparations for departing from the capital, the inhabitants
became much enraged. A crowd collected around
the carriage intended, as they concluded, to convey the
last of the royal family out of Spain; the traces were cut
and imprecations heaped upon the French. Colonel La
Grange, Murat's aide-de-camp, happening to appear on
the spot, was cruelly maltreated, and in a moment the
whole capital was in an uproar. The French soldiery were
assaulted everywhere, about seven hundred being slain.
The French cavalry, hearing the tumult, entered the city
and a bloody massacre ensued. Many hundreds were made
prisoners. The troops then charged through the streets
from end to end, released their comrades, and ere nightfall
had apparently restored tranquility. Murat ordered all the
prisoners to be tried by a military commission, which
doomed them to instant death.</p>

<p>The reports of the insurrection spread rapidly throughout
the peninsula, and in almost every town in Spain
depredations were committed against the French citizens,
many of the acts being fomented by agents of England,
whose navies hung along the coast inflaming the passions
of the multitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>Napoleon received this intelligence with alarm, but he
had already gone too far to retreat. He proceeded, therefore,
to act precisely as if no insurrection had occurred.
Tranquility being re-established in Madrid the Council of
Castile was convoked and Napoleon's brother Joseph was
chosen by an imperial decree as their ruler. Ninety-five
notables met him in Bayonne and swore fealty to him and
a new constitution. Joseph on entering Spain was met
by many demonstrations of disapproval and hatred, but the
main road being occupied with Napoleon's troops, he
reached Madrid in safety.</p>

<p>England now became anxious to afford the Spaniards
every assistance possible. On the 4th of July the king
addressed the English parliament on the subject, declaring
that Spain could no longer be considered the enemy of
Great Britain, but was recognized by him as a natural
friend and ally. Supplies of arms and money were liberally
transmitted thither, and Portugal, catching the flame, and
bursting into general insurrection, a treaty of alliance,
offensive and defensive was soon concluded between
England and the two kingdoms of the peninsula.</p>

<p>It was impossible for Napoleon to concentrate the whole
of his gigantic strength of 500,000 men on the soil of
Spain, as his relations with those powers on the Continent
whom he had not entirely subdued, were of the most
unstable character. His troops, moreover, being drawn
from a multitude of different countries and tongues, could
not be united in heart or discipline like the soldiers of a
purely national army. On the other hand the military
genius at his command had never been surpassed in any
age or country. His officers were accustomed to victory,
and his own reputation exerted a magical influence over
both friends and foes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>At the moment when the insurrection occurred, 20,000
Spanish troops were in Portugal under the orders of Junot;
15,000 more under the Marquis de Roma were serving
Napoleon in Holstein. There remained 40,000 Spanish
regulars, 11,000 Swiss and 30,000 militia to combat 80,000
French soldiers then in possession of half of the chief fortresses
of the country.</p>

<p>After various petty skirmishes, in which the French
were uniformly successful, Bessieres came upon the united
armies of Castile, Leon and Galicia, commanded by
Generals Cuesta and Blak on the 14th of July at Riosecco,
and defeated them in a desperate action in which not less
than 20,000 Spaniards were killed. This calamitous battle
opened the gates of Madrid to the new king, who arrived at
the capital on the 20th of the month only to quit it again in
less than a fortnight to take up his head quarters at Vittoria
to preserve his safety. The English government,
meanwhile, had begun its preparations for interfering
effectually in the affairs of the peninsula. Thousands of
English troops were landed, Dupont, Lefebvre and Junot
meeting with reverses that resulted finally in the evacuation
of the whole French army from Portugal.</p>

<p>The battle of Baylen was one of the first and most
fatal reverses of the French. Here, after a desperate
engagement on the 23rd of July, upwards of 18,000 men,
under General Dupont, surrendered to the Spaniards,
defiled before the Spanish army with the honors of war,
and deposited their arms in the manner agreed on by both
parties. General Dupont and all the officers concerned in
the capitulation, who were permitted to return to
France, were arrested and held in prison. Napoleon
deeply appreciated the importance of the reverse which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
his armies had sustained, but he still more bitterly felt the
disgrace. It is said that to the latest period of his life he
manifested uncontrollable emotion at the mention of this
disaster. Subsequently an imperial decree appeared, which
prohibited every general, or commander of a body of men,
to treat for any capitulation while in the open field; and
declared disgraceful and criminal, and as such, punishable
with death, every capitulation of that kind, of which the
result should be to make the troops lay down their arms.</p>

<p>The catastrophe at Baylen and the valiant defense of
Saragossa had in some measure opened the eyes of Napoleon
to the character of the nation with whom he was
contending. He acknowledged, too late, that he had
imprudently entered into war, and committed a great fault
in having commenced it with forces too few in number
and too wildly scattered. On hearing of the ill-luck of his
three generals, he at once perceived that affairs in the
peninsula demanded a keener eye and a firmer hand than
his brother's, and he at once resolved to take the field
himself, to cross the Pyrenees in person at the head of a
force capable of sweeping the whole peninsula "at one
fell swoop," and restore to his brother's reign the auspices
of a favorable fortune.</p>

<p>When setting out from Paris in the early part of October,
1808, the Emperor announced that the peasants of Spain
had rebelled against their king, that treachery had caused
the ruin of one corps of his army, and that another had
been forced by the English to evacuate Portugal. Recruiting
his armies on the German frontier and in Italy, he now
ordered his veteran troops to the amount of 200,000, including
a vast and brilliant cavalry and a large body of the
Imperial Guards, to be drafted from those frontiers
and marched through France towards Spain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>As these warlike columns passed through Paris Napoleon
addressed to them one of those orations that never
failed to fill them with enthusiasm. "Comrades," said he
at a grand review which was held at the Tuileries on the
11th of September, "after triumphing on the banks of the
Danube and the Vistula, with rapid steps you have passed
through Germany. This day, without a moment of repose,
I command you to traverse France. Soldiers, I have need
of you. The hideous presence of the English leopard
contaminates the peninsula of Spain and Portugal. In
terror he must fly before you. Let us bear our triumphant
eagles to the pillars of Hercules; there also we have
injuries to avenge. Soldiers! You have surpassed the
renown of modern armies; but you have not yet equalled
the glory of those Romans, who, in one and the same
campaign were victorious on the Rhine and the Euphrates,
in Illyria and on the Tagus! A long peace, a lasting
prosperity, shall be the reward of your labors. A real
Frenchman could not, should not rest, until the seas are
free and open to all. Soldiers, what you have done and
what you are about to do, for the happiness of the French
people, and for my glory, shall be eternal in my heart."</p>

<p>Having thus dismissed his faithful troops, Napoleon
himself traveled rapidly to Erfurt, where he had
invited the Emperor Alexander to confer with him. Here
they addressed a joint letter to the King of England, proposing
once more a general peace, but as they both refused
to acknowledge any authority in Spain save that of King
Joseph, the answer was in the negative. Austria also positively
refused to recognize Joseph Bonaparte as King
of Spain, and this answer was enough to satisfy Napoleon
that she was determined on another campaign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 14th of October the conference at Erfurt terminated,
Napoleon sincerely believing himself the friend of
Alexander, and little thinking he would one day say of
him: "He is a faithless Greek!" Ten days later Napoleon
was present at the opening of the legislative session
at Paris, where he spoke with confidence of his designs
and hopes in regard to Spain. "I depart in a few days
to place myself at the head of my troops," he said, "and,
with the aid of God, to crown the king of Spain in
Madrid, and plant my eagles on the forts of Lisbon."</p>

<p>Two days later he left the capital and reached
Bayonne on the 3rd of November, where he remained
directing the movements of the last columns of his army
until the morning of the 8th. He arrived at Vittoria, the
headquarters of his brother Joseph, on the same evening.
At the gates of the town he was met by the civil and
military authorities, where sumptuous preparations had
been provided, but instead of accepting their hospitality,
entered the first inn he observed, and calling for maps and
a detailed report of the position of all the armies, French
and Spanish, proceeded instantly to draw up his plan for
the prosecution of the war. Within two hours he had completed
his task. Soult, who had accompanied him from
Paris, set off on the instant, and within a few hours the
whole machinery of the army, comprising 200,000 men,
was in motion.</p>

<p>Ere long Napoleon saw the main way to Madrid open
before him, except some forces said to be posted at the
strong defile of the Somosierra, within ten miles of the
capital. Saragossa on the east, the British army in Portugal
on the west, and Madrid in front were the only far-separated
points on which any show of opposition was still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
to be traced from the frontiers of France to those of Portugal,
and from the sea <ins title="'coast'? 'east'?">cost</ins> to the Tagus.</p>

<p>Having regulated everything on his wings and rear,
the Emperor with his Imperial Guards and the first division
of the army, now marched towards Madrid, his vanguard
reaching the foot of the Somosierra chain on the 30th of
November. Here he found that a corps of 12,000 or 13,000
men had been assembled for the defense of that pass under
General San Juan, an able and valiant officer who had
established an advance guard of 3,000 men at the very
foot of the slope which the French would have to
ascend, and then distributed over 9,000 men at
the pass of Somosierra, at the bottom of the gorge; there
the advancing army would be obliged to go through. One
part of San Juan's force, posted on the right and left of the
road, which formed numerous windings, was to stop
the advance of the French by a double fire of musketry.
The others barred the causeway itself, near the most difficult
part of the pass, with the battery. The defile was
narrow and excessively steep, and the road completely
swept by sixteen pieces of cannon.</p>

<p>At daybreak on the 1st of December the French began
their attempts to turn the flank of San Juan, who imagined
himself invincible in his position. Three battalions
scattered themselves over the opposite sides of the defile
and a warm skirmishing fire had begun. At this moment
Napoleon came up, at the head of the cavalry of his Guard
rode into the mouth of the pass, surveyed the scene for
an instant, and perceiving that his infantry was making
no progress, at once conceived the daring idea of causing
his brave Polish lancers to charge up the causeway
in face of the battery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>The Emperor had stopped near the foot of the mountain
and attentively examined the enemy's position, the
fire from which seemed to redouble, many balls falling
near him, or passing over his head. Colonel Piré was
first dispatched at the head of the Poles and having
reconnoitred the position, countermanded the advance, and
sent an officer to notify Napoleon "that the undertaking
was impossible." Upon this information the Emperor
much irritated and striking the pommel of his saddle
exclaimed, "Impossible! Why, there is nothing impossible
to my Poles."</p>

<p>General Wattier, who was present endeavored to calm
him but he still continued to exclaim, "Impossible! I
know of no such word. What, my Guard checked by
the Spaniards,&mdash;by armed peasants?" At this moment
the balls began to whistle about him and several officers
came forward and persuaded him to withdraw. Among
these Napoleon observed Major Philip Ségur; to him he
said, "Go, Ségur, take the Poles, and make them take
the Spaniards, or let the Spaniards take them."</p>

<p>Colonel Piré, having informed Kozietulski, commander
of the Polish troops, of what the Emperor had said, that
officer replied, "Come then alone with me, and see if the
devil himself, made of fire as he is, would undertake this
business."</p>

<p>Advancing, they saw 13,000 Spaniards placed as if in
an amphitheatre in such a way that no one battalion was
masked by another, and they could only join in columns.
From that point the Poles had to sustain forty thousand
discharges of musketry and as many of cannon, every
minute. However, the order was positive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"Commandant," said Ségur, "let us go, it is the Emperor's
wish; the honors will be ours; Poles advance.
Vive l'Empereur!" Napoleon wished to teach his soldiers
that with the Spaniards they must not consider
danger, but drive them wherever found.</p>

<p>The smoke of the skirmishers on the side hills mingled
with the thick fog and vapors of the morning, and under this
veil the brave cavalry of the Guard led the way fearlessly
and rushed up the ascent. A brilliant cavalry officer,
General Montbrun, at this time somewhat out of favor
with the Emperor, advanced at the head of the Polish
light horse, a young troop of elite which Napoleon had
formed at Warsaw that he might have all nations and
costumes in his Guard. General Montbrun with those
gallant young soldiers dashed at a gallop upon the cannon
of the Spaniards, and in defiance of a horrible fire of
musketry. The first squadron received a discharge which
threw it into disorder, sweeping down thirty or forty men
in the ranks; but those that followed, passing
beyond the wounded, reached the pieces, cut down the
gunners and took all the cannon.</p>

<p>As the rushing steeds passed the Spanish infantry the
latter fired and then threw down their guns, abandoned their
intrenchments and fled. The brave San Juan, covered
with blood, having received several wounds, strove in
vain to stop his soldiers, who fled to the right and to the
left in the mountains, leaving colors, artillery, 200 wagons
with stores and almost all the officers in the hands of the
victors. By the time the Emperor reached the top not
only was the French flag found floating over Buitrago,
but Montbrun's cavalry was pursuing the routed Spanish a
league beyond the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Napoleon was delighted to have proved to his generals
what the Spanish insurgents were, what his soldiers were,
and in what estimation both were to be held, and to have
overcome an obstacle which some had seemed to think extremely
formidable. The Poles had about fifty men killed
or wounded. That evening Napoleon complimented and
rewarded the survivors and included in the distribution
of his favors M. Philippe de Ségur who had received
several shot wounds in this charge; he also destined him to
carry to the Legislative Body at Paris the colors taken at
Somosierra and appointed Montbrun general of division.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 2nd three divisions of French
cavalry made their appearance on the high ground to the
north-west of the capital. The inhabitants of Madrid for
eight days had been preparing to resist an invasion. Six
thousand regular troops were within the town, and crowds
of citizens and of the peasantry of the adjacent country
were in arms with them. The pavement had been taken
up, the streets barricaded, the houses on the outskirts
loop-holed and occupied by a strong garrison. Many persons,
suspected of adhering to the side of the French,
were put to death, and amid the ringing of the bells of
churches and convents, a general uprising for all means
of defense was in operation when the French cavalry
appeared.</p>

<p>The day was the anniversary of Napoleon's coronation
and of the battle of Austerlitz, and for the Emperor as
well as his soldiers a superstition was attached to that
memorable date. The fine cavalry, on beholding its
glorious chief, raised unanimous acclamations, which
mingled with the shouts of rage sent up by the Spaniards
on seeing the French at their portals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>At noon the town was summoned to open its gates. The
young officer carrying the message barely escaped with
his life, the mob being determined to massacre him. Only
the interference of the Spanish regulars saved his life by
snatching him out of the hands of the assassins. The
Junta directed a Spanish general to convey a negative
answer to the summons of the French. When sent back
he was assured that firing would commence immediately,
although told that in resisting they would only expose a
population of women, and children and old men to the
slaughter, and was informed that the city could not hold
out long against the French army.</p>

</div>

<p>Napoleon waited until his artillery and infantry came
up in the evening and then the place was invested on one
side. The Emperor made a reconnaissance himself on
horseback around Madrid and formed the plan of attack
which might be divided into several successive acts, so as
to summon the place after each of them, and to reduce it
rather by intimidation than by the employment of formidable
military means.</p>

<p>At midnight the city was again summoned and the
answer still being defiant, the batteries began to open.
Terror now began to prevail within, and shortly afterward
the city was summoned for the third time. Thomas de
Morla, the governor, came to demand a suspension of arms.
He said that all sensible men in Madrid were convinced
of the necessity of surrendering; but that it was necessary
to make the French troops retire and allow the Junta time
to pacify the people and to induce them to lay down their
arms.</p>

<p>Napoleon replied with some show of anger that Morla
himself had excited and misled the people: "Assemble
the clergy, the heads of the convents, the alcaldes, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
principal proprietors," he said "and if between this and
six in the morning the city has not surrendered it shall
have ceased to exist. I neither will nor ought to withdraw
my troops.... Return to Madrid. I give you till six
tomorrow morning. Go back, then; you have nothing
to say to me about the people but to tell me that they have
submitted. If not, you and your troops shall be put to
the sword."</p>

<p>Morla returned to the town and urged the necessity of
instantly capitulating, to which all the authorities but Costellas,
the commander of the regular troops agreed. The
peasantry and citizens continued firing on the French
outposts during the night and then Costellas, seeing that
further resistance was useless, withdrew his troops and
sixteen cannon in safety.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock on the morning of the 4th Madrid
surrendered. The Spaniards were at once disarmed and
the French troops filled the town and established themselves
in the great buildings. Napoleon took up his residence
in a country house near the capital. He gave
orders for a general and immediate disarming, and tranquility
was once more restored, the shops and theatres
being opened as usual.</p>

<p>Napoleon now exercised all the rights of a conqueror
and issued edicts abolishing, among other evils, the
Inquisition of the Jesuits, as well as the feudal institutions
of the Middle Ages. He received a deputation of the chief
inhabitants who came to signify their desire to see his
brother Joseph among them again. His answer was that
Spain was his own by right of conquest; that he could
easily rule it by viceroys; but if they chose to assemble in
their churches, priests and people, and swear allegiance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Joseph, he was not indisposed to listen to their request.
He distinctly affirmed that he would, in case they proved
disloyal, put the crown upon his own head, treat the country
as a conquered province and find another kingdom for his
brother: "for" added he, "God has given me both the
inclination and the power to surmount all obstacles."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Napoleon was making arrangements for
the completion of his conquest. His plan was to invade
Andalusia, Valencia and Galicia by his lieutenants, and
march in person to Lisbon.</p>

<p>On learning on December 19th that the English army
under Sir John Moore, amounting to 20,000, men, had put
itself in motion, had advanced into Spain and left Salamanca
to proceed to Valladolid; that a separate British corps
of 13,000 men under Sir David Baird had recently landed
at Corunna with orders to march through Galicia and
effect a junction with Moore, either at Salamanca or Valladolid,
Napoleon resolved to advance in person and overwhelm
Moore. His resolution was instantly taken with
that promptness of decision and unerring judgment
which never forsook him. He instantly put himself at the
head of 50,000 men and marched with incredible rapidity,
with the view of intercepting Moore's communications
with Portugal, and in short hemming the English commander
in between himself and Soult.</p>

<p>Moore no sooner heard that Napoleon was approaching
than he perceived the necessity of an immediate retreat;
and he commenced, accordingly, a most calamitous one
through the naked mountains of Galicia, in which his
troops displayed a most lamentable want of discipline.
They ill-treated the inhabitants, straggled from their ranks,
and in short lost the appearance of an army except when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the trumpet warned them that they might expect the
French to charge.</p>

<p>Leaving Chamartin on the morning of the 22nd of
December Napoleon arrived at the foot of the Guadarrama
as the infantry of his Guard was beginning to ascend
it. The weather, which till then had been superb, had
suddenly become terrible, and at the very moment when
forced marches were to be performed, as it was necessary
that they lose no time in coming up with the English.</p>

<p>Napoleon, seeing the infantry of his Guard accumulating
at the entrance of the gorge, in which the gun-carriages
were also crowded together, spurred his horse into a
gallop, and gained the head of the column which he found
detained by the hurricane. The peasants declared that it
was impossible to pass without being exposed to the
greatest dangers. This, however, was not sufficient to
stop the conqueror of the Alps. He made the chasseurs
of his Guard dismount, and ordered them to advance first
in close column, conducted by guides. These bold fellows,
marching at the head of the army, and trampling down
the snow with their own feet and those of their horses,
formed a beaten track for the troops who followed.</p>

<p>The Emperor himself climbed the mountain on foot,
amidst the chasseurs of his Guard, merely leaning, when
he felt fatigued, on the arm of General Savary. The cold,
which was as severe as at Eylau, did not prevent him
from crossing the Guadarrama. General Marbot, who
accompanied Napoleon on the journey, says in his "Memoirs":
"A furious snowstorm, with a fierce wind,
made the passage of the mountains almost impracticable.
Men and horses were hurled over precipices.
The leading battalions had actually begun to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
retreat; but Napoleon was resolved to overtake the English
at all cost. He spoke to the men, and ordered that
the members of each section should hold one another by the
arm. The cavalry, dismounting, did the same. The staff
was formed in similar fashion, the Emperor between
Lannes and Duroc, we following with locked arms; and
so, in spite of wind, snow and ice, we proceeded, though
it took us four hours to reach the top. Half way up the
marshals and generals, who wore jackboots, could go no
farther. Napoleon, therefore, got hoisted on to a gun,
and bestrode it; the marshals and generals did the same,
and in this grotesque order they reached the convent at the
summit. There the troops were rested and wine served
out. The descent though awkward, was better."</p>

<p>Napoleon spent the night in a miserable post-house in
the little village of Espinar. On the mules laden with
his baggage had been brought the wherewithal to serve
him with supper, and which he shared with his officers,
cheerfully conversing with them on that series of extraordinary
adventures which had commenced at the school of
Brienne&mdash;to end, he knew not where!</p>

<p>Next day the Emperor proceeded with his Guard; but
the infantry advanced with difficulty and the artillery
could not stir owing to the frightful quagmires. The
stragglers and baggage came up slowly while Napoleon,
anxious to meet the fleeing English troops, pushed
on with his advance guard and with his chasseurs until
Benevento was reached. Here he came up with his own
troops in pursuit of Moore at Benevento, on the 29th of
December, and enjoyed for a moment, from his headquarters
established there, the spectacle of the English army in full
retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>The French columns seemed to rival each other in their
efforts to overtake the enemy. In their precipitation the
English abandoned their sick, hamstrung their horses,
when unable to keep up with them, and destroyed the
greater part of their ammunition and baggage.</p>

<p>Marshal Soult, who had taken another road, was much
nearer the enemy. His orders to follow the English
intermission were difficult of accomplishing as the mud was
deep and the soldiers sank up to their knees.</p>

<p>Napoleon now decided that Moore was no longer worthy
of his own attention and intrusted the consummation of his
ruin to Soult, who was ordered to pursue the English to the
last extremity, and "with his sword at their loins." He therefore
set out at once, his troops marching past the Emperor.</p>

<p>Soult hung close on the rear of the English; he came up
with them in the mountains of Leon and continued to
pursue them until they reached the port of Corunna. Here
Moore perceived that it would be impossible to embark without
a convention or battle and he chose the latter. The
attack was made by the French on the 16th of January in
heavy columns and with their usual vivacity; but it was
sustained and repelled by the English and they were permitted
to embark without further molestation. Sir John
Moore fell in the action mortally wounded by a cannon
shot. His body was wrapped in a military cloak, instead
of the usual vestments of the tomb, and deposited in a
grave hastily dug on the ramparts of the citadel of Corunna,
while the guns of the enemy paid him funeral
honors. The next morning the grenadiers of France, who
had been struck with admiration at the chivalry of the
English commander, gathered reverently around the new-made
grave, and while the English fleet was yet visible on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the bosom of the Mediterranean, they erected a monument
over his body and placed thereon an appropriate
inscription.</p>

<p>Napoleon, having been informed of the embarkation of
the English army, instead of returning to Madrid to complete
his Spanish conquest, proceeded at once towards
Astorga where his fears with reference to Austria were
heightened by news from Paris by courier. The storm
that was gathering once more along the shores of the
Danube was of more vital consequence to France than the
kingdom of Joseph Bonaparte. On his arrival at Astorga
he changed all his plans. "It was late at night when
the Emperor and Lannes, escorted only by their staffs, and
some hundred cavalry, entered Astorga," says General
Marbot. "So tired and anxious for shelter and warmth
was everyone that the place was scarcely searched. If
the enemy had had warning of this, and returned on their
tracks, they might perhaps have carried off the Emperor;
fortunately they were in too great a hurry, and we did not
find one of them in the town. Every minute fresh bodies
of French troops were coming up and the safety of the
Imperial headquarters was soon secured."</p>

<p>Proceeding to Valladolid with his Guard, which he wished
to keep as near to events in Germany as himself, after
placing Joseph on the throne at Madrid again, he soon
afterwards hastened to Paris with all speed, riding on post
horses on one occasion not less than eighty-five miles
in five and one-half hours. He had traversed Spain with
the rapidity of lightning, followed by his Guard, to the
spot where new dangers and triumphs awaited him. He
left behind a feeble king, equally as incapable of keeping
as obtaining a conquest; and marshals who, no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
restrained by the presence of an inflexible chief, for the
most part delivered themselves over to their own self-love
or private jealousies.</p>

<p>In his "Memorial" written in exile at St. Helena,
Napoleon said "that the war of Spain destroyed him, and
that all the circumstances of his disasters connect themselves
with this fatal knot." "In the crisis France was
placed in," he said at another time, "in the struggle of
new ideas in the great cause of the age against the rest of
Europe, we could not leave Spain behind."</p>

WAR WITH AUSTRIA, 1809.</h2>

<p class="p2">Before Napoleon returned to Paris from Spain he learned
that, yielding to England's instigations, Austria was
about to take advantage of his being so far away, to cross
its borders, invade Bavaria, carry the war to the banks of
the Rhine, and then effect the liberation of Germany.
The opportunity was an excellent one for attempting such
an undertaking. The Emperor had been compelled to
send the pick of his battalions to the other side of the
Pyrenees, thus greatly reducing the number of French
foes in Germany. The French minister of foreign affairs,
Talleyrand, had during Napoleon's absence made every
effort to conciliate the Emperor Francis, but the warlike
preparations throughout the Austrian dominions proceeded
with increasing vigor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>After the declaration of war by Austria on the 6th of
April, couriers were at once dispatched with orders to
the armies on the Rhine, and beyond the Alps, to concentrate
themselves on the field. To the ambassadors at
Paris the Emperor spoke most freely of the coming conquest.
"They have forgotten the lessons of experience
there," he said; "They want fresh ones; they shall have
them, and this time they shall be terrible I promise you.
I do not desire war; I have no interest in it, and all
Europe is witness that my whole attention and all my
efforts were directed towards the field of battle which
England had selected, that is to say, Spain. Austria,
which saved the English in 1805 when I was about to
cross the straits of Calais, has saved them once
more by stopping me when I was about to pursue
them to Corunna. She shall pay dearly for this new
diversion in their favor. Either she shall disarm instantly,
or she shall have to sustain a war of destruction.
If she disarms in such a manner as to leave no doubt on
my mind as to her further intentions, I will myself sheathe
my sword, for I have no wish to draw it except in Spain
against the English; otherwise the conflict shall be immediate
and decisive, and such that England shall for the
future have no allies on the Continent."</p>

<p>The instant Napoleon ascertained that Bavaria was
invaded by the Archduke Charles, he at once proceeded,
without guards, without equipage, accompanied solely by
the faithful Josephine, to Frankfort and thence to Strasbourg.
Here he assumed command of the army on the
13th of April, and immediately formed the plan of his
campaign. He found the two wings of his army, the one
under Massena, the other under Davoust, at such a distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
from the centre that, had the Austrians seized the
opportunity, the consequences might have been fatal to
the French.</p>

<p>On the 17th of April, while at Donawerth, Napoleon
commanded Davoust and Massena to march simultaneously
towards a position in front, and then pushed forward
the centre in person, to the same point. The Archduke
Louis, who commanded the Austrian divisions in
advance, was thus hemmed in unexpectedly by three
armies, moving at once from three different points.</p>

<p>At Donawerth Napoleon addressed his troops in a proclamation
in which he said: "Soldiers, the territory of the
Confederation has been violated. The Austrian general
expects us to fly at the sight of his arms, and to abandon
our allies to him. I arrive with the rapidity of lightning.
Soldiers, I was surrounded by you when the sovereign
of Austria came to my camp in Moravia; you have heard
him implore my clemency, and swear an eternal friendship
towards me. Victors, in three wars Austria has owed
everything to your generosity; three times has she perjured
herself. Our past successes are a safe guarantee of
the victory which awaits us. Let us march, and at our
aspect may the enemy acknowledge his conqueror."</p>

<p>It should be remembered that at this time, while
Napoleon was astonishing Europe by the rapidity of his
movements, and the display of the resources of his
military and political genius, he had left an army in the
Peninsula, distributed over an immense space of territory,
weakened by diseases, reduced by partial combats, and
without receiving reinforcements from the interior of the
Empire. During the whole of the German campaign of
1809, the French in Spain were merely able to maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
themselves in the positions they had occupied soon after
Napoleon's departure.</p>

<p>Austria had reckoned on the absence of Napoleon and
his Guard, and on the veteran troops of Marengo and Austerlitz
being far distant. She knew that there did not remain
more than 80,000 French scattered throughout Germany,
while her army divided into nine bodies, under the orders
of the Archduke Charles, had not less than 500,000 men.</p>

<p>The Archduke Louis was defeated and driven back at
Abensberg on the 20th, and utterly routed at Landshut
on the 21st, losing 9,000 men, thirty guns and all his
stores. Those unfortunate Austrians who had been led
from Vienna singing songs, under a persuasion that
there was no longer a French army in Germany, and that
they should only have to deal with Wurtemburgers and
Bavarians, experienced the greatest terror when they
came to conflict and found themselves defeated. The
Prince of Lichtenstein and General Lusignan, were
wounded, while the loss of the Austrians in colonels, and
officers, of lower rank was considerable.</p>

<p>In the battle of Abensberg which occurred on the 20th,
Napoleon was resolved to destroy the corps of the Archduke
Louis, and of General Keller, amounting to sixty
thousand men. The enemy only stood his ground for an
hour and left eighteen thousand prisoners. The cannonade
of the French was successful at all points and the Austrians,
disconcerted by Napoleon's brilliant movements,
beat a hasty retreat leaving eight standards and twelve
pieces of cannon. The French loss was very small.</p>

<p>Before this engagement Napoleon saw defile before him
on the plateau in front of Abensberg the Wurtemberg and
Bavarian troops, allies of the French, who were going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
put themselves in line and whom the pride of fighting
under a general of his renown filled with enthusiasm.
The Emperor caused them to be drawn up and proceeded
to harangue them, one after the other, the officers translating
his words to the troops. He said that he
was making them fight, not for himself, but for
themselves; against the ambition of the house of
Austria, which was enraged at not having them, as
of yore, under its yoke; that this time he would
soon restore them peace, and forever, and with such an
increase of power that for the future they should be able
to defend themselves against the pretensions of their old
dominators. His presence and words electrified his
German allies, who were flattered to see him amongst
them, he trusting entirely to their honor, for at that
moment he had no other escort than some detachments of
Bavarian cavalry.</p>

<p>When Napoleon arrived that evening at Rotterburg he
was intoxicated with joy. The engagement, which was
of short duration, had cost the Austrians 7,000 or 8,000
men, and he saw his adversary driven back on the Iser
at the very beginning of the campaign, and the Austrian
soldiers disheartened, like the Prussians after Jena.</p>

<p>The battle of Landshut completed the defeat of the
preceding evening. On this day General Mouton, at the
head of a column of grenadiers rushed through the
flames that were consuming one of the bridges of the Iser;
"Forward, but reserve your fire!" he shouted to the
soldiers in a voice of thunder; and in a few moments he
had penetrated into the town, which then became the seat
of a sanguinary struggle, and which the Austrians were
not long in abandoning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day Napoleon executed a variety of manoeuvres,
considered as amongst the most admirable of his science,
by means of which he brought his whole force, by different
routes, at one and the same moment upon the
position of the Archduke Charles, who was strongly
posted at Eckmuhl with 100,000 men. On both sides all
was ready for a decisive action. Until 8 o'clock a thick
fog enveloped that rural scene which was soon to be
drenched with the blood of thousands of men. As soon
as it cleared away both sides prepared for action. Not a
musket or a cannon shot was fired before noon, however.</p>

<p>There was no need of a signal for battle as the terrible
contest began on both sides simultaneously about 2 o'clock
in the afternoon, Napoleon commanding and leading the
charge, and accompanied by Lannes and Massena. One
of the most beautiful sights war could produce now presented
itself; one hundred and ten thousand men were
attacked on all points, turned to their left, and successively
driven from all their positions, although not a half
of the French troops were engaged. The battle was
stern and lasted until twilight, ending with the utter
defeat of the Archduke's army, and leaving Napoleon
with 20,000 prisoners, fifteen imperial standards and a
vast number of cannon in his hands, while the defeated
and routed enemy fled back in confusion on the city of
Ratisbon. The Austrian cavalry, strong and numerous,
attempted to cover the retreat of the infantry, but was
attacked by the French both on the right and left. The
Archduke Charles was only indebted for his safety to the
fleetness of his horse, when darkness at length compelled
the victors to halt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>While the French were galloping along the road in
pursuit of the Austrians, finding the plain to which they
had retreated swampy, they endeavored to regain the road,
and thus became mingled with the mass of victorious
cavalry. A multitude of single combats then took place
by the uncertain light of the moon, and nothing was
heard but the clashing of sabres on their cuirasses, the
shouts of the commandants, and the heavy tramp of
horses. The French cuirassiers, wearing double cuirasses,
which covered them all round, could more easily defend
themselves than the Austrians, who, having only breastplates,
fell in great numbers, mortally wounded by the
thrusts dealt them from behind. Night put an end to a
contest where there were scenes of carnage that had not
been equalled in years.</p>

<p>At the battle of Abensberg the Emperor beat separately
the two corps of the Archduke Louis and General Keller;
at the battle of Landshut he took the centre of their communications
and the general depot of their magazines and
artillery; and, finally, at the battle of Eckmuhl, the corps
of Hohenzollern, Rosenberg, and Lichtenstein, were
defeated.</p>

<p>The Austrians, astonished by rapid movements beyond
their calculation, were soon deprived of their sanguine
hopes, and precipitated from a delirium of presumption to
a despondency bordering on despair. Two days later the
Archduke made an attempt to rally his troops, and not
only to hold Ratisbon, but to meet Napoleon. He was
obliged to give up the place at the storming of the walls
by the French, who drove the Austrians through the
streets. All who resisted were slain. The enemy's commander
fled precipitately into Bohemia, abandoning once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
more the capital of the Austrian Empire to the mercy of
the Conqueror.</p>

<p>Napoleon was wounded in the foot during the storming
of Ratisbon. He had approached the town amidst a fire
of sharpshooters kept up by the Austrians from the walls,
and by the French from the edge of a ditch. Whilst he
was looking through a telescope he received a ball in the
instep, and said, with the coolness of an old soldier: "I
am hit!" When the Emperor received his wound he was
talking with Duroc. "This," said he to his marshal,
"can only come from a Tyrolian; no other marksman
could take an aim at such a distance; those fellows are
very clever."</p>

<p>The wound might have been dangerous for had it
been higher up the foot would have been shattered and
amputation inevitable. The first surgeon of the Guard,
Dr. Larrey, being near took off his boot and prepared to
dress the wound, which was not serious.</p>

<p>At the news that the Emperor was wounded the troops
crowded around him in great alarm. Officers and soldiers
ran up from all sides; in a moment he was surrounded
by thousands of men, in spite of the fire which the enemy's
guns concentrated on the vast group. The Emperor,
wishing to withdraw his troops from this useless danger,
and to calm the anxiety of the more distant corps who
were getting unsteady in their desire to come and see what
was the matter, mounted his horse the instant his wound
was dressed and rode down the front of the whole line
amid loud cheers. Those around remonstrated with him
for continually exposing his person, to which he replied:
"What can I do? I must see how things are going on."</p>

<p>"It was at this extempore review," says General Mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>bot,
"held in presence of the enemy, that Napoleon first
granted gratuities to private soldiers, appointing them
Knights of the Empire and members, at the same time, of
the Legion of Honor. The regimental commanders recommended,
but the Emperor also allowed soldiers who thought
they had claims, to come and represent them before him;
he then decided upon them himself."</p>

<p>An old grenadier, who had made the campaigns of
Italy and Egypt, not hearing his name called, came up,
and in a calm tone of voice asked for the cross.</p>

<p>"But," said Napoleon, "what have you done to
deserve it?"</p>

<p>"It was I, sir, who, in the desert of Joppa, when it
was so terribly hot, gave you a watermelon!"</p>

<p>"I thank you for it again," said the Emperor, "but
the gift of the fruit is hardly worth the cross of the
Legion of Honor." Then the grenadier, who up till
then had been as cool as ice, working himself up into a
frenzy, shouted at the top of his voice, "Well, and don't
you reckon seven wounds received at the bridge of Arcola,
at Lodi, at Castiglione, at the Pyramids, at Acre, Austerlitz,
Friedland; eleven campaigns in Italy, Egypt,
Austria, Prussia, Poland&mdash;."</p>

<p>But the Emperor cut him short laughing, and mimicking
his excited manner, cried;&mdash;"There, there, how you
work yourself up when you come to the essential point!
That is where you ought to have begun; it is worth much
more than your melon. I make you a Knight of the
Empire, with a pension of 1200 francs. Does that
satisfy you?"</p>

<p>"But your Majesty, I prefer the cross."</p>

<p>"You have both one and the other since I make you a
Knight."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I would rather have the cross," and the worthy
grenadier could not be moved from that point. It took
much explaining to make him understand that the title
of Knight of the Empire carried with it the Legion of
Honor. He was not appeased on this point until the
Emperor had fastened the decoration on his breast, and
he seemed to think a great deal more of this than of his
annuity of 1200 francs.</p>

<p>It was by familiarities of this kind that the Emperor
made the soldiers adore him, but as Marbot again well says,
it was a means that was only available to a commander
whom frequent victories had made illustrious; any other
general would have impaired his reputation by it.</p>

<p>Napoleon now sent an aide-de-camp to Lannes urging
him to expedite the taking of Ratisbon. This intrepid
marshal had directed all his artillery against a projecting
house which rose above the wall surrounding the
town. The house was knocked down and the ruins
fell into the ditch. Still there were two fortified positions
to take. Ladders were procured and placed at the
critical points by the grenadiers, but every time one of
them appeared he was instantly brought down by the
well-aimed balls of the Austrian sharpshooters. After
some men had been thus struck, the rest appeared to hang
back. Thereupon Lannes advanced, covered with decorations,
seized one of the ladders and cried out: "You
shall see that your marshal, for all he is a marshal, has
not ceased to be a grenadier!" Two aides-de-camp
sprang forward and snatched the ladder out of his hands,
and the grenadiers followed them, took the ladders, and,
notwithstanding the continued fire of the sharpshooters,
made the crossing in safety, followed by hundreds of
others in an instant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>The walls being scaled, the town was soon in the hands
of the French, who rushed along the blazing streets taking
prisoners in all directions. Suddenly they were stopped
with a cry of terror uttered by the Austrians; "Take care,
we shall all be blown up!" shouted an officer. There
were some barrels of powder left in the street which were in
danger of being fired by the shots exchanged on either
side. The belligerents stopped with one accord and joined
hands in removing the barrels to a place of safety. The
Austrians then withdrew and left the town to the French
troops.</p>

<p>After the taking of Ratisbon Napoleon issued an address
to his soldiers complimenting them highly on their valor.
"You have justified my expectations," he said. "You
have made up for numbers by your courage; you have
gloriously marked the difference which exists between
the soldiers of Cæsar and the armies of Xerxes. In a few
days we have triumphed in the three battles of Tann,
Abensberg and Eckmuhl, and the affairs of Peising,
Landshut and Ratisbon. One hundred pieces of cannon,
fifty thousand prisoners, three equipages, three thousand
baggage wagons, all the funds of the regiments, are the
results of the rapidity of your marches, and of your
courage.... Before a month we shall be in
Vienna!"</p>

<p>Thus in five days, in spite of inferiority of numbers and
of the unfavorable manner in which his lieutenants had
distributed an inferior force; by the sole energy of his
genius, did Napoleon triumph over the main force of his
opponent. The Emperor reviewed his army on the 24th,
distributing rewards of all sorts with a lavish hand. Upon
Davoust he bestowed the title of Duke of Eckmuhl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>On May 3rd a body of 30,000 Austrians remaining from
the army of Landshut, fell back upon Ebersberg, where
Massena engaged in a stubborn battle, General Claparéde
being obliged to defend himself for three hours with but
7,000 men against 30,000 Austrians. Reinforcements at
last arrived and the enemy retired in disorder upon the
Ens, where they burned the bridge so as to protect their
flight in the direction of Vienna. The battle cost the
Austrians 12,000 men, of whom 7,500 were prisoners.
The field of carnage was hideous, and the town of Ebersberg
was so wrapped in flames that the wounded could
not be withdrawn. To prevent the fire from reaching the
bridge it had been necessary to cut off the approach at
either end, so that communication was interrupted for
several hours between the troops who had crossed the river
and those coming to their aid. Napoleon had galloped up
on hearing the cannonade, and though inured to all the
horrors of war, is said to have been greatly shocked at the
sight he beheld.</p>

<p>Passing before the ruins of the castle of Dirnstein, on
an eminence beyond the Molck, and in the direction of
Vienna, whither he was going, Napoleon said to Marshal
Lannes, who was at his side: "Look! Behold the prison
of Richard Coeur de Lion. Like us, he went to Syria
and Palestine. Coeur de Lion, my brave Lannes, was not
braver than thou. He was more fortunate than I at St.
Jean d'Acre. The Duke of Austria sold him to an emperor
of Germany who had him imprisoned there. That
was in the barbarous ages. How different to our own
civilization! You have seen how I treat the Emperor of
Austria, whom I could have taken prisoner. Ah! well!
I shall treat him again in the same manner. It is not my
wish, but that of the age!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>From Molck the headquarters of the Emperor were
transferred to St. Polten and two days later, at 9 o'clock
in the morning, Napoleon was at Vienna, which he desired
to take forthwith, but to take without destroying if
possible.</p>

<p>Meeting with resistance in entering the city, the inhabitants
having prepared for a vigorous defense, Napoleon
began to play with his heavy batteries upon the city.
The bombardment soon convinced them that it was hopeless
to resist, and Vienna surrendered May 12th after
suffering severely. In a few hours eighteen hundred
shells had fallen in the city. The streets were narrow,
the houses high, and the population crowded within the
narrow fortifications, were terrified and infuriated at the
sight of the damage caused by the shells which started
fires in every direction. Who would have said to the
Viennese, who were then hurling all manner of imprecations
at Napoleon, the author of all their woes, that ten
months later they would be singing the praise of this
detested Emperor, and would be voluntarily setting
French flags in their windows as symbols of friendship?</p>

<p>All the royal family had fled except the young Archduchess
Marie Louise, who was detained in the palace,
suffering from small-pox. When Napoleon heard she
was sequestered there he ordered that no battery should
be directed to that part of the town in which lay she who
was destined to be his bride within less than a year! At
this time Napoleon himself would no doubt have laughed
heartily had he been told that in that palace was a woman
who was to succeed Josephine in his struggle for a
dynasty, to be Empress of the French, and later, to bear
him the long wished for son and heir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>That Marie had no such thoughts or inclinations can
readily be guessed from the fact of the present campaign
in which her father, the Emperor, was battling for his
Empire. The Emperor Francis had left his capital on
April 8th, 1809, leaving there his wife and children, but
all of whom departed, except Marie, on May 5th. From
Vienna Marie wrote frequently to her father. A rumor
had reached the capital that the battle of Eckmuhl had
been a brilliant victory for the Austrians, and the young
Archduchess wrote to her father on April 25th: "We
have heard with delight that Napoleon was present at the
great battle which the French lost. May he lose his head
as well! There are a great many prophecies about his
speedy end, and people say that the Apocalypse applies to
him. They maintain that he is going to die this year at
Cologne, in an inn called the 'Red Crawfish.' I do not
attach much importance to these prophecies, but how glad
should I be to see them come true!"</p>

<p>On May 13th the capitulation of the Austrian capital
was signed, and Napoleon's army again entered Vienna,
the Emperor taking up his old quarters at the imperial
palace of Schoenbrunn. He said to his soldiers: "The
people of Vienna, according to the expression of the
deputation, wearied, deserted, widowed, shall be the
object of your regards. I take the inhabitants under my
special protection. As for the turbulent and ill-disposed,
I will make a severe example of them. Let us be kind
towards the poor peasants, towards these good people,
who have so many claims upon our esteem. Let us not
be vain of all our successes; but look upon them as a
proof of that divine justice which punishes ingratitude
and perjury."</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI">XI</a><br />

THE BATTLE OF WAGRAM</h2>

<p class="p2">The Austrian army, in abandoning the capital of the
Empire, had not renounced the war, although in thirty-three
days Napoleon had, with one stroke of his sword,
cut in two the mass of their armies, and with a second
burst open the gates of Vienna. He was now firmly established
in that capital, and master of the main resources
of the monarchy; but his work was far from being done,
either in Austria or in Germany. A great difficulty
remained to be overcome,&mdash;that of crossing a vast river
in the face of the enemy, and to give battle with the river
behind him. This difficulty Napoleon had been unable
to prevent, and it resulted inevitably from the nature
of things. On leaving Ratisbon he had been obliged
to take the route which was shortest, thus keeping the
two main divisions of the Austrian army separated from
each other. He was consequently obliged to march
along the right bank of the Danube, abandoning the left
to the Austrians, but securing to himself exclusively the
means of crossing from the one to the other.</p>

<p>The Archduke Charles was soon tempted to quit the
fastness of Bohemia, and try once more the fortune of a
battle. Having re-established the order, and recruited
the numbers of his army to 100,000 men, he was soon
posted on the banks of the Danube. Opposite were the
French, and the river being greatly swollen, and all the
bridges destroyed, the two armies seemed separated by an
impassable barrier. Napoleon determined to pass it and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
after an unsuccessful attempt at Nussdorff, met with better
fortune at Ebersdorff, where the river is broad and intersected
by a number of low and woody islands, the largest
of which bears the name of Lobau. Here Massena had
thrown several bridges over the arms of the Danube.</p>

<p>On these islands Napoleon established the greater part
of his army on May 19th, and on the following day made
good his passage by means of a bridge of boats to the left
bank of the Danube, where he took possession of the
villages of Asperne and Essling, with so little show of
opposition that it became evident that the Archduke wished
the inevitable battle to take place with the river between
his enemy and Vienna.</p>

<p>On the 21st, at daybreak, the Archduke appeared on a
rising ground, separated from the French position by an
extensive plain. His whole force was divided into five
heavy columns and protected by not less than two hundred
pieces of artillery. The battle began at 4 o'clock in the
afternoon with a furious assault on the village of Asperne,
which was taken and retaken several times, and remained
at nightfall in the occupation partly of the French and
partly of the assailants, who had established themselves
in the church and churchyard. Essling sustained three
attacks also, but there the French remained in complete
possession. At one time Lannes, who defended this point,
was so hard pressed, that he must have given way had
not Napoleon relieved him, and obtained him a breathing
spell by a well-timed and terrific charge of cavalry under
Bessieres, which fell upon their centre.</p>

<p>Night finally interrupted the action, the Austrians exulting
in their partial success; and Napoleon surprised that
he should not have been wholly victorious. On either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
side the carnage had been terrible, and the pathways of
the villages were literally choked with the dead.</p>

<p>Just as Napoleon was about to retire for a few hours'
rest he was interrupted by a violent altercation between
two of his chief lieutenants, Bessieres and Lannes, the
former of whom complained of the language used by the
latter, his inferior in rank, in giving a necessary order for
a charge of cuirassiers and chasseurs, then under the
orders of Marshal Bessieres himself. Massena, who was
on the spot, was obliged to interfere between these gallant
men, who after having braved for a whole day the cross-fire
of 300 pieces of cannon, were ready to draw their
swords for the sake of their offended pride. Napoleon
allayed their quarrel, which was to be terminated next
day by the enemy in the saddest way for themselves and
for the army.</p>

<p>Next morning the battle recommenced at 4 o'clock
with equal fury, the French recovering Asperne; but the
Austrian right wing renewed its assaults on that point,
and in such numbers that Napoleon guessed that their
centre and left had been weakened for the purpose of
strengthening their right. Believing this he instantly moved
such masses upon the Austrian centre that the Archduke's
line was shaken, and for a moment it seemed as if
the victory of the French was secure. In fact it was
extremely doubtful if the Austrian centre could withstand
the mass of 20,000 infantry and 6,000 horse which Lannes
had thrown upon it.</p>

<p>The Archduke Charles now hastened to the spot to
prevent the catastrophe that threatened his centre, and in
this critical moment discharged at once the duties of a
general and a common soldier. He brought up reserves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
replaced the gaps which had been made in his line by the
furious onslaught of the French, and while awaiting the
execution of these orders, seized a standard and himself
led the grenadiers to the charge, while his bravest officers
were struck down by his side. Lannes, who also headed
his soldiers in person, seeing the Austrian infantry disordered,
let loose upon them Bessieres and his own cuirassiers,
who, charging Hohenzollern's corps, broke several
squares and took prisoners, cannon and flags.</p>

<p>Success now seemed certain, and Lannes sent a staff
officer to acquaint Napoleon of his progress and asked
him to cover his rear whilst he was advancing in the plain
and leaving so large a space between him and Essling.
The officer found Napoleon watching the grand spectacle
of which he was the director. He did not express anything
like the satisfaction he might have been expected
to feel at such a communication. The fact was, an unfortunate
accident had occurred. At this critical moment the
bridge connecting the island of Lobau was being wholly
swept away by means of fire-ships sent down the river
by the Austrians. Napoleon at once perceived that if he
wished to preserve his communication with the right of
the Danube, where his reserve still lay, he must instantly
fall back on Lobau. The want of troops, however, was
not the first consequence of the rupture of the bridge, for
the 60,000 already passed over were enough to beat the
Austrians. What was most to be regretted was the want
of ammunition, a prodigious quantity of which had already
been consumed, and of which there would soon be a
scarcity.</p>

<p>Napoleon therefore resolved upon a painful sacrifice in
order not to expose himself to risks which prudence for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>bade
him to brave. Having formed this resolution, in an
instant he ordered the staff officer to return to Lannes as
fast as possible and tell him to suspend the movement and
fall back gradually on the Essling and Asperne line. He
was also to recommend the marshal to be sparing of
ammunition.</p>

<p>On receiving this order Lannes and Bessieres were compelled,
to their deep regret, to halt in the midst of the
vast plain of Marchfield. No sooner did the French troops
commence their backward movement than the Austrians
recovered their order and zeal, charged in turn, and finally
made themselves masters of Asperne.</p>

<p>Essling, where Massena commanded, held firm, and
under the protection of that village and numerous batteries
erected near it, Napoleon succeeded in withdrawing his
whole force during the night. The Commander had sent
earlier in the day to inquire of Massena if he could rely
on the possession of Asperne; for as long as it and Essling
remained, the safe retreat of the army was insured. The
staff officer who took the message found Massena on a
heap of rubbish, harassed with fatigue, with blood-shot
eyes, but with unabated energy of spirit.</p>

<p>On receiving the message he stood up and replied with
extraordinary emphasis: "Go tell the Emperor I will
hold out two hours,&mdash;twenty-four&mdash;so long as it is necessary
for the safety of the army!"</p>

<p>It was during this exciting retreat that a dreadful
calamity befell the army. Whilst Lannes was galloping
in front of the line from one corps to another, encouraging
the soldiers by his voice and example, an officer who
was alarmed at seeing him exposed to so much danger,
entreated him to dismount for greater safety. He followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the advice, though it was far from his habit to be careful
of his life. At that instant he was struck by a cannon
ball that shattered both his knees. Bessieres and an aide
raised him up, and found him bathed in blood and almost
senseless. Bessieres, with whom he had quarreled on the
preceding day, pressed his weak hand. He was laid on a
cuirassier's cloak and carried to a little bridge where an
ambulance was stationed. The news soon spread through
the army and filled it with sorrow. The surgeon declared
his wounds to be mortal.</p>

<p>In his frenzy the brave marshal called for Napoleon,
his friend. The latter observed a group advancing, supporting
Lannes on a bier formed of crossed fire-locks and
some branches of oak. Twelve old grenadiers, covered
with blood and dust, bore this illustrious warrior along.
As soon as the Emperor saw it was the Duke of Montebello
he hastened to meet him. The grenadiers stopped,
and Napoleon, throwing himself upon his old companion-in-arms,
who had fainted from the loss of blood, in a
voice scarcely articulate, said, several times, "Lannes, my
friend, do you know me? It is the Emperor, it is
Bonaparte, your friend."</p>

<p>At these words Lannes opened his eyes, till then closed,
collected his spirits, and made some attempts to speak;
but, being unable, he could only lift his dying arms to
pass them round the neck of Napoleon. The fear of
exhausting the little life still remaining in the marshal
determined the Emperor to leave him.</p>

<p>Sometime later Napoleon visited his wounded friend
and conversed with him briefly. "My noble marshal,"
said the Emperor, "It is all over." "What!" cried the
dying man, "can't <i>you</i> save me?" He died in delirium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
some days later in the arms of his chief, who wept over him
as he had done at the death of Desaix at Marengo. The
French soldiery delighted to call him the "Roland of the
Camp," and Napoleon said, "It was impossible to be more
brave than Lannes." No man could inspire his troops
with more confidence than could this brave soldier who
had been the companion of the fortunes and glory of Napoleon
from the very beginning of his public career.</p>

<p>Napoleon had charged Lannes to maintain Essling at
all hazards and he valiantly fulfilled his task. At length,
at nine at night, the sanguinary conflict ceased; the
French preserving the position they had occupied in the
morning, and the Austrians bivouacking where they
were. Both sides sustained an equal loss, from fifteen to
twenty thousand men having been killed, or wounded, on
both sides. Among the Austrians were four field-marshals,
eight generals and six hundred and sixty-three
officers killed or wounded.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 23rd of May the French were
cooped up in Lobau and the adjacent islands,&mdash;Asperne and
Essling&mdash;the whole left bank of the river, remaining in the
possession of the Austrians. On either side a victory
was claimed. In the eyes of Europe it was a check for
Napoleon, accustomed to crush his enemy, to have been
unable at this time to drive the Austrians from their
position.</p>

<p>The situation of the French Emperor was imminently
hazardous; he was separated from Davoust and his
reserves, and, had the enemy either attacked him in the
islands, or passed the river higher up and so overwhelmed
Davoust and relieved Vienna, the results might have
been fatal. But the Archduke's loss in these two days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
had been very great; and, in place of risking an offensive
movement, he contented himself with strengthening the
position of Asperne and Essling, and awaiting quietly the
moment when his enemy should choose to attempt once
more the passage to the left bank, and the reoccupation of
these stubbornly contested villages.</p>

<p>Napoleon availed himself of this pause with his usual
skill. That he had been checked was true, and that the
news would be heard with enthusiasm, he well knew. It
was necessary, therefore, to regain the fame which had
surrounded the beginning of the campaign, and he made
every preparation for another decisive battle. Some weeks
elapsed ere he ventured to assume the offensive.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July, 1809, Napoleon at last re-established
his communication with the right bank, and arranged the
means of passing to the left at a point where the Archduke
had made hardly any preparation for receiving him.
On the 5th of July, at 10 o'clock at night, the French
began to cross from the islands in the Danube to the left
bank. Gunboats prepared for the purpose silenced some
of the Austrian batteries; others were avoided by passing
the river out of reach of their fire on bridges that
had been secretly erected by the French. When Napoleon
had a river to be crossed he began the operation by
suddenly conveying some determined men to the opposite
side in boats. These proceeded to disarm or kill the
enemy's advanced posts, and to fix the moorings to which
the boats were to be attached that were to carry the bridge.
The army then passed over as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The first of these operations was the most difficult in
presence of an enemy so numerous and so well prepared
as were the Austrians. To facilitate it, Napoleon had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
large flat boats constructed, capable of carrying 300 men
each, and having a moving gunwale to protect the men
from musketry, which on being let down, would serve instead
of planks for landing. Every corps was provided with
five of these flat-boats, which made an advance guard
of 1500 men carried over at once, and the enemy, not
knowing exactly where the crossing would be made,
could not confront the French with advanced posts in
sufficient numbers to prevent their landing.</p>

<p>The Austrians having rashly calculated that Asperne
and Essling must needs be the object of the next contest,
as of the preceding, they were taken almost unawares
by Napoleon's appearance in another quarter. They
changed their line on the instant and occupied a
position, the centre and key of which was the little town
of Wagram. Here, on the 6th of July, the final and
decisive battle was to be fought. Adding together the
troops of Massena, Oudinot, Davoust, Bernadotte, Prince
Eugene, Macdonald, Marmont, de Wrede and the Guard,
there appeared to be 150,000 men; of whom 26,000 were
cavalry and 12,000 artillerymen serving 550 guns; an
enormous force, such as Napoleon had never yet mustered
on a field of battle, and according to some authorities,
such a host as had never been brought into action
by any leader. Besides this vast force Napoleon had
with him the invincible Massena, who was then suffering
from a fall from his horse, but who was capable of mastering
all physical sufferings on a day of battle; the
stubborn Davoust, the impetuous Oudinot, the intrepid Macdonald,
and a multitude of others who were ready to purchase
the triumph of the French arms with their blood.
The heroic Lannes was the only one missing. Fate had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
forbidden him to witness a victory to which he had powerfully
contributed by his conduct in this campaign.</p>

<p>When the day dawned on the banks of the river, about
4 o'clock in the morning, a most imposing spectacle presented
itself to both armies. The sun glistened on thousands
of bayonets and helmets, and seventy thousand men
were already in line of battle on the enemy's side of the
river capable of making a good fight with the Archduke's
forces. Seeing Napoleon ride along the front of the lines
his soldiers raised their shakos on their bayonets and cried:
"Vive l'Empereur!" The ground covered by the two
armies was about two leagues in extent. The troops
nearest were about 1200 fathoms from the city of Vienna,
so that the towers, steeples, and tops of the highest
houses, were covered by the numerous population, thus
become spectators of the terrible contest then preparing.</p>

<p>The Archduke had extended his line over too wide a
space, and his former error enabled Napoleon to at once see
an opportunity to ruin him by his old device of pouring
the full shock of his strength on the centre. In fact, so
apparently weak was the position of the Austrians at this
time that the Emperor, in his bulletin of the engagement
sent to Paris, had this to say: "This disposition of the
army appeared so absurd that some snare was dreaded,
and the Emperor hesitated some time before ordering the
easy dispositions which he had to make in order to annul
those of the enemy, and render them fatal to him." At
sunrise the cannonade commenced upon the two lines.
Napoleon, perceiving that the Prince of Rosemberg was
moving upon Marshal Davoust, repaired in person to
the right wing, which he reinforced with the cuirassiers
under General Arrighe, and caused twelve pieces of light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
artillery to advance upon the flank of the enemy's columns.
After an obstinate engagement of two hours' duration,
Davoust succeeded in repulsing his adversary as far
as Neusiedel.</p>

<p>While the French army thus signalized itself by
success in the beginning of the day, the battle was carried
along the rest of the line with great determination. The
fire of musketry and cannon was now general on that vast
front of nearly three leagues, along which 300,000 men and
1100 pieces of cannon were arrayed against each other.
It was a principle of Napoleon's that by concentrating
on one point the action of certain special arms that grand
effects were to be produced, and therefore it was that he
bestowed an immense amount of artillery on the Guard
and had kept under his hand a reserve of fourteen regiments
of cuirassiers.</p>

<p>The Emperor now ordered that the whole of the artillery
of the Guard, together with all that could be spared by the
several corps, advance at a gallop. Just then General
de Wrede arrived on the ground with twenty-five pieces of
excellent artillery, and solicited the honor of taking part
in the decisive movement, to which Napoleon consented.
He then sent for General Macdonald, his design being to
shake the Austrian centre with 100 guns, and then pierce
it with Macdonald's bayonets and Nansouty's sabres.
These orders were obeyed on the instant.</p>

<p>While awaiting the carrying out of these movements,
impatient for the arrival of Macdonald and Lauriston,
Napoleon rode about the field on his Persian horse of dazzling
whiteness, giving orders to his aides constantly. The
cannonading had by this time acquired the frequency of
musket-firing, and everybody shuddered at the thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
of seeing the man, on whose life so many destinies
depended, struck by one of those blind messengers of
death. The hundred guns were now ranged in line and
instantly began the most tremendous slaughter ever
known to those who witnessed it. Napoleon observed
with his glass the effect of that formidable battery, saw
the enemy's artillery dismounted, and was satisfied with
the correctness of his own conceptions. But artillery was
not sufficient to break the Austrian centre; bayonets, too,
were requisite.</p>

</div>

<p>The intrepid Macdonald now advanced at the head of
his corps under a deluge of fire, leaving the ground
covered at every step with his dead and wounded, still
closing the ranks without wavering, and communicating
his own gallant bearing to his soldiers. "What a brave
man!" Napoleon exclaimed several times, as he saw him
thus march under the shower of grape and bullets. The
Archduke's centre, shaken by the fire of a hundred pieces of
ordinance, retreats, as does also his right. Davoust now
shakes the Austrian left wing, and as he does so Napoleon
exclaims: "The battle is won!",&mdash;and so it was. Lauriston,
with a hundred pieces of cannon, and Macdonald at the
head of a chosen division, charged the Austrians in the
centre and broke through it. The victory was for the
French once more.</p>

<p>At length the Austrian army fell into disorder, their
centre was driven back two or three miles out of the line;
cries of alarm were heard, the right wing gave way and
the left soon followed. The rout was now complete.
At the close of the battle there remained 20,000 prisoners,
besides all the artillery and baggage in the hands
of the French. Napoleon showed all his courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
and talents on this day, and was ever in the
hottest of the action, though the appearance of his
retinue drew on him showers of grape by which he
was repeatedly endangered. From early morning, he
was occupied in galloping through the different lines,
encouraging the troops by his presence and persuasive
eloquence; many being killed by the balls that
flew about him. It was observed that the enemy's
fire was particularly directed against the Emperor; in
consequence of which Napoleon was obliged to change
his surtout three times. The aides-de-camp and officers
of the staff were also given to understand that they should
keep more at a distance, and the regiments were instructed
not to salute the Emperor with acclamations at the
moment he was passing.</p>

<p>On the following morning, after surveying the field of
battle, Napoleon went to place himself in the midst of his
troops who were about to pursue the retreating enemy.
He walked round the bivouacs without either hat or
sword, his hands being crossed behind him, and as he
talked with the soldiers of his Guard his manner and countenance
expressed the utmost satisfaction and confidence.
On passing Macdonald, with whom he had lost favor, and
who had not followed the fortunes of the Emperor for
some years, Napoleon stopped and held out his hand,
saying: "Shake hands, Macdonald; no more animosity
between us, we must henceforth be friends; and, as a
pledge of my sincerity, I will send you your marshal's
staff, which you so gloriously earned in yesterday's
battle." The general, pressing the Emperor's hand
affectionately, exclaimed: "Ah, sire; with us it is
henceforth for life and for death." The act was height<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>ened
by the grace and good will with which it was performed.
The same rank was granted a few days after to
General Oudinot and the Duke of Ragusa (Marmont),
for their eminent services.</p>

<p>After the battle Napoleon recognized among the dead
a colonel who had displeased him. He stopped and
looked at the mangled body for a moment and then said,
"I regret not having told him before the battle that I had
forgotten everything."</p>

<p>The Archduke fled in great confusion as far as Znaim
in Moravia, abandoning, as trophies of his defeat, ten
standards, forty pieces of cannon, nearly 18,000 prisoners,
nine thousand wounded, and a great quantity of equipage.</p>

<p>The loss of the French, while much less than that of
the enemy, was 6,000 wounded and 2,600 killed. Marshal
Bessieres was among the former. The French army had
to lament the loss of the valiant LaSalle, one of the first
generals of light cavalry. His death was greatly regretted
both by the Emperor and the army. He was considered
the best light cavalry officer for outpost duty and had the
surest eye. He could take in a whole district in a moment,
and seldom made a mistake, so that his reports on the
enemy's position were clear and precise. He was a handsome
man of bright wit, an excellent horseman and
brave to the point of rashness. He first attracted the
notice of General Bonaparte at the battle of Rivoli when
he galloped down a descent to which the fleeing Austrians
had resorted to escape, and took some thousand prisoners
under the eyes of General Bonaparte and the army. From
that time LaSalle was in high favor with Napoleon who
promoted him rapidly and took him to Egypt where he
made him colonel. He distinguished himself at Austerlitz
and in Prussia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>The Imperial Council perceived that further resistance was
useless and an armistice was agreed to at Znaim. Napoleon,
on returning to Vienna, continued occupied until
October. For the third time he found himself master of
the destinies of the House of Lorraine, which he had
accused of ingratitude and perjury before Europe and in
the face of history; for the third time this conqueror, so
violent in his menaces, so overwhelming in his reproaches,
eagerly received the proposals of those who had provoked
the war, whose hopes had been overthrown, and whose
resources were destroyed on the day of Wagram. The
results of the battle, without being as extraordinary as
those of Austerlitz, Jena or Friedland, were great nevertheless.</p>

<p>The announcement of the armistice with Austria put
an end, in effect, to all hostile demonstrations on the Continent,
except in the Peninsula, and Germany in apparent
tranquility awaited the result of the negotiations of
Vienna.</p>

<p>A few days after Napoleon had returned to Schoenbrunn
from Moravia he narrowly escaped the dagger of a young
man who rushed upon him at a grand review of the
Imperial Guard, and while in the midst of all his staff.
Berthier and Rapp threw themselves upon the would-be
assassin and disarmed him at the moment when his knife
was about to enter the Emperor's body.</p>

<p>Napoleon demanded to know what motive had
actuated the assassin. "What injury," said he, "have I
done to you?"</p>

<p>"To me personally, none," answered the youth, "but
you are the oppressor of my country; the tyrant of the
world; and to have put you to death would have been
the highest glory of a man of honor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The youth, a son of a clergyman of Erfurt named
Staaps, was condemned to death. It is said Napoleon
wished to pardon Staaps, whose frankness and courage
had struck him, and in whom, besides, he saw but a
blind instrument of the passions incited by the monarchy;
but his orders arrived too late. The young German met
his death with the greatest coolness, exclaiming: "Hail,
Liberty! Germany forever! Death to the tyrant!"</p>

<p>The length to which the negotiations with Austria were
protracted excited much wonder, but Napoleon, who was
occupied incessantly with his ministers and generals, and
seldom showed himself in public, had other business on
hand besides his treaty with the Emperor Francis. His
long-standing quarrel with the Pope now reached its
crisis, growing out of the Concordat, involving affairs in
Spain and Portugal, and finally by a refusal of the pontiff
to acquiesce in the Berlin and Milan decrees against
England's commerce. On the 17th of May Napoleon had
issued from Vienna his final decree declaring the temporal
sovereignty of the Pope to be wholly at an end, incorporating
Rome with the French Empire, and declaring it to
be his second city, settling a handsome pension on the
holy father in his spiritual capacity, and appointing a
committee of administration for the civil government of
Rome. The Pope replied with a bull of excommunication
against Napoleon which finally resulted in the removal of
His Holiness to Fontainebleau where he continued a
prisoner, though treated personally with respect and magnificence,
during more than three years.</p>

<p>The treaty with Austria was at last signed at Schoenbrunn
on the 14th of October, Austria giving up territory
to the amount of 45,000 square miles, with a population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
of four millions, and depriving her of her last seaport.
Yet, when compared with the signal triumphs of the
campaign at Wagram, the terms on which the conqueror
signed the peace were universally looked upon as remarkable
for moderation. Napoleon afterwards expressed himself
as highly culpable in having left Austria too powerful
after the affair at Wagram, using the following words on
that occasion: "The day after the battle I ought to have
published in the order of the day that I would ratify no
treaty with Austria, until after a previous separation of
the crown of Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia; to be placed
on three different heads."</p>

<p>Napoleon quitted Vienna on the 16th of October, and
was congratulated by the public bodies of Paris at Fontainebleau
on the 14th of November as "the greatest of
heroes, who never achieved victories but for the happiness
of the world." When he reappeared at the palace at Fontainebleau
on Oct. 26th 1809, crowned with the victory of
Wagram, there was one to whom dark forebodings came&mdash;Josephine
felt that her fate was sealed. In fact, as a
modern writer has said, the immediate result of Wagram
was the divorce from the Empress.</p>

<p>The first public intimation of a measure which had for
a considerable period occupied Napoleon's thoughts came
from the Emperor himself when he said, in an imperial
speech in which he described the events of the past year,
and the state of France: "I and my house will ever be
found ready to sacrifice everything, even our own dearest
ties and feelings, to the welfare of the French people."</p>

CAMPAIGN OF RUSSIA</h2>

<p class="p2">Long before Napoleon assumed the imperial title his
hopes of offspring from the union with Josephine were at
an end, but the Empress lived for a time in hope that the
Emperor would be content to adopt her son Eugene.
Louis Bonaparte married Hortense Beauharnais, daughter
of Josephine, and an infant son became so much the
favorite of Napoleon that the Empress, as well as others,
come to regard this boy as the heir of France. But the
child died early and the Emperor then began to direct
his thoughts towards the best means of dissolving his
marriage with Josephine, in order that he might form an
alliance with some daughter of Russia, or other imperial
family. The Emperor Alexander was approached on this
subject, and informed that one of his sisters, the Grand
Duchess Anne, would be acceptable, but the Empress-mother
hesitated, and this being taken by Napoleon as a
refusal, he sought the hand of the Archduchess Marie
Louise, daughter of the Emperor Francis of Austria.</p>

<p>On the 15th of December, 1809, the Emperor summoned
his council and announced to them, that at the expense of
all his personal feelings, he, devoted wholly to the welfare
of the State, had resolved to separate himself from his
most dear consort. "Arrived at the age of forty years"
he said, "I may conceive the hope of living sufficiently
long to elevate, in my mind and after my ideas, the
children with which it shall please Providence to bless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
me. God knows how much this resolution has cost my
heart; *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I should also add, that, far from ever
having to complain, I have on the contrary, only had
cause to laud the attachment and tenderness of my beloved
wife. She has adorned fifteen years of my life. The
recollection thereof will always remain graven on my
heart."</p>

<p>Josephine then appeared among them, and not without
tears, expressed her acquiescence in the decree. "I
believe I acknowledge all these sentiments," she said,
"by consenting to the dissolution of a marriage which, at
present, is an obstacle to the welfare of France, which
deprives it of being one day governed by the descendants
of a great man, so evidently raised by Providence to efface
the ills of a terrible revolution, and re-establish the altar,
the throne, and social order."</p>

<p>The council, after addressing the Emperor and Empress
on the nobleness of their mutual sacrifice, accepted and
ratified the dissolution of marriage. The title of Empress
was preserved to Josephine for life and a pension of two
million francs, to which Napoleon afterwards added a third
million from his privy purse. She then retired from the
Tuileries, residing thenceforth mostly at Malmaison, and in
the course of a few weeks Austria was called upon for her
daughter.</p>

<p>Having given her hand at Vienna on the 11th of March,
1810, to Berthier, who had the honor to represent the person
of the Emperor, the young Archduchess set out for France
on the 13th.</p>

<p>On the 28th, as her carriage was proceeding towards
Soissons, Napoleon rode up to it, in a plain dress,
altogether unattended, and introduced himself to his proxy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
bride. She had never seen his person till then, and it is
said her first exclamation was, "Your Majesty's pictures
have not done you justice."</p>

<p>They spent the evening at the chateau of Compiegne
and a religious marriage was celebrated on the 1st of
April at St. Cloud amidst every circumstance of splendor;
the next day they made their entry into the capital.
Napoleon in his exile said that "the Spanish ulcer" and
the Austrian match were the two main causes of his ruin;&mdash;and
they both contributed to it largely, although by no
means equally. The Exile's own opinion was that the
error lay, not in seeking a bride of imperial birth, but in
choosing her at Vienna. Had he persisted in his demands,
the Czar, he doubted not, would have granted him his
sister; the proud dreams of Tilsit would have been realized,
and Paris and St. Petersburg become the only two capitals
of Europe. Possibly, then, he would not have had occasion
to say that he "set his foot upon an abyss of roses" when
he married Marie.</p>

<p>Had he married a daughter of France, or even an
imperial princess of Russia, he could have done so without
the sacrifice of the prestige of the nobility, and even
the divinity of the people he had so gloriously contended
for; but when it was announced that he had contracted
an alliance with the House of Hapsburg,&mdash;that hated race
against whom and whose principles he had fought
a hundred battles, they were convinced that no good would
come of it&mdash;and they were right.</p>

<p>The war, meanwhile, continued without interruption in
the Peninsula; whither, but for his marriage Napoleon
would certainly have repaired in person, after the peace of
Schoenbrunn left him at ease. So illy was that Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
campaign conducted during Napoleon's absence that not
an inch of soil could be counted by the French beyond
their outposts. Their troops were continually harassed
and thinned by the indomitable guerrillas who acted singly
or in bands as occasion offered.</p>

<p>The Emperor's marriage was speedily followed on
the 20th of April, 1811, by the birth of a son and heir
whom Napoleon announced to the waiting courtiers in
these words: "It is a King of Rome!" The happy
event, announced to the populace by the firing of one
hundred and one guns, was received with many demonstrations
of loyal enthusiasm. Even Josephine joined in
expressing her satisfaction at the event which seemed to
portend so much for the founding of a Napoleonic dynasty
which the Emperor now saw possible by direct lineage.</p>

<p>When the Emperor of Russia was informed of Napoleon's
approaching nuptials with the Austrian princess
his first exclamation was, "Then the next thing will be
to drive us back into our forests." In truth the conferences
at Erfurt had but skinned over a wound which nothing
could have cured but a total alteration of Napoleon's
policy. The Russian nation suffered so much from the
continental system that the Czar soon found himself
compelled to relax the decrees drawn up at Tilsit in the
spirit of those previously declared at Berlin and Milan.
Certain harbors were opened partially for the admission
of colonial produce and the export of native productions;
and there ensued a series of indignant reclamations on the
part of Napoleon, and haughty evasions on that of the
Czar, which, ere long, satisfied all near observers that
Russia would not be slow to avail herself of any favorable
opportunity of once more appealing to arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>During the summer of 1811 the relations of Russia and
France were becoming every day more dubious and when
towards the close of it the Emperor of Austria published
a rescript granting a free passage through his territories
to the troops of his son-in-law, England, ever watchful
of her great enemy, perceived clearly that France was
about to have an ally. Alexander had long since ceased
to regard the friendship of the great man as a blessing of
heaven. Of the solemn cordiality of Tilsit, and the more
recent meeting at Erfurt, there remained in the soul of
the Czar naught but the displeasure and resentment
arising from extinct affection and deceived hopes.</p>

<p>From the moment in which the Russian government
began to reclaim seriously against certain parts of his
conduct, Napoleon increased by degrees his military force
in the north of Germany, and the Grand Duchy of
Warsaw, and advanced considerable bodies of troops
nearer and nearer to the Czar's Polish frontier. These
preparations were met by similar movements on the
other side; yet, during many months, the hope of terminating
the differences by negotiations was not abandoned.
The regulations of the Continental System were especially
objected to by Russia, and the Czar having lent his ear to
the representations of the English cabinet, asked that
they be dispensed with as he declared he could no longer
submit to see the commerce of an independent Empire
trammeled for the purpose of serving the policy of a
foreign power.</p>

<p>Napoleon admitted that it might be necessary to modify
the system complained of, and expressed his belief that it
would be found possible to devise some middle course by
which the commercial interests of France and Russia might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
be reconciled. A very considerable relaxation in the
enforcement of the Berlin code was at last effected, and a
license system arranged which admitted Alexander
to a share in the pecuniary advantages. Had there been
no cause of quarrel between these powers except what
appeared on the face of their negotiations, it is hardly to
be doubted but a new treaty might have been effected.
The Czar, however, from the hour of Marie Louise's
marriage, felt a conviction that the diminution of the Russian
power in the north of Europe would form the next
great object of Napoleon's ambition. The Czar therefore
assured himself that if war must come, there could be no
question as to the policy of bringing it on before Austria
had entirely recovered from the effects of the campaign of
Wagram, and, above all, while the Peninsula continued
to occupy 200,000 of Napoleon's troops.</p>

<p>As concerned the Spanish armies, it might still be said
that King Joseph was in military possession of all but
some fragments of his kingdom. The English had been
victorious in Portugal and the French troops in Spain
lost more lives in this incessant struggle, wherein no glory
could be achieved, than in any similar period spent in any
regular campaign; and Joseph, while the question of
peace or war with Russia was yet undecided, became so
weary of his situation, that he earnestly entreated Napoleon
to place the crown of Spain on some other head.
Such were the circumstances under which the eventful
year of 1812 began.</p>

<p>Most persuasive appeals were made to Napoleon by his
ministers to refrain from entering into a campaign of
aggression against Russia. To Fouché, minister of police,
Napoleon is reported to have said, in reply, "Is it my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
fault that the height of power which I have attained compels
me to ascend to the dictatorship of the world? My
destiny is not yet accomplished,&mdash;the picture exists as yet
only in outline. There must be one code, one court of
appeal, and one coinage for all Europe. The states of
Europe must be melted into one nation, and Paris be its
capital."</p>

<p>In the arguments used by Napoleon's advisers at this
time they attempted to show him, among other things, the
great extent of Alexander's resources,&mdash;his 400,000
regulars, and 50,000 Cossacks, already known to be in
arms&mdash;and the enormous population on which he had the
means of drawing for recruits; the enthusiastic national
feeling of the Muscovites; the distance of their country;
the severity of their climate; the opportunity which a war
would afford to England of urging her successes in Spain;
and the chance of Germany rising in insurrection in case
of any reverses.</p>

<p>With the greater part of the population of France, and
especially with the army, the threatened war was exceedingly
popular. Russia, the most extensive Empire in
Europe, it was fondly imagined, was on the point of
falling before the power of the Great Nation; and England
would then be left to struggle, unaided, for mastery
with France. It was deemed a certain pledge of victory,
since the Emperor himself was to lead his veteran legions
to the new scene of triumph.</p>

<p>Cardinal Fesch, uncle of the Emperor, appealed to him
on other grounds. The Cardinal had been greatly affected
by the treatment of the Pope, and he contemplated this
new war with dread,&mdash;as likely to bring down the vengeance
of heaven upon the head of one who had dared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
to trample on its vice-regent. Napoleon led the Cardinal
to the window, opened it, and pointing upwards,
said, "Do you see yonder star?"</p>

<p>"No Sire," replied the Cardinal. "But I see it,"
answered Napoleon; and the churchman was dismissed.</p>

<p>Trusting to this star,&mdash;his "Star of Destiny" in which
he yet firmly believed,&mdash;he was far from being awed when
in April, 1812, Russia declared war against France. It
was an indefensible violation of the treaty of Tilsit, but it
showed Napoleon that Europe was determined to crush
him, and he rallied the forces of his Empire for a more
terrible conflict than he had yet been summoned to.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with disposing everything for war in the
bosom of the Empire, Napoleon, who wished to march
into Russia at the head of his vast army of Europe, busied
himself in forming and cementing, externally, powerful
allies. Two treaties were concluded to this effect; the
one with Prussia and the other with Austria on the 24th
of February and 14th of March, 1812.</p>

<p>Alexander's minister was ordered in the beginning of
April to demand the withdrawal of the northern troops,
together with the evacuation of the fortress in Pomerania,
in case the French government still entertained a wish to
negotiate. Napoleon replied that he was not accustomed
to regulate the distribution of his forces by the suggestions
of a foreign power. The ambassador then demanded his
passports and quitted Paris.</p>

<p>The Emperor of France was confident, and seems to
have entertained no doubt of his success in the coming
campaign. "The war" he said, "is a wise measure,
called for by the true interests of France and the general
welfare. The great power I have already attained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
compels me to assume an universal dictatorship. My views
are not ambitions. I desire to obtain no further acquisition;
and reserve to myself only the glory of doing good,
and the blessings of posterity."</p>

<p>Leaving Paris with the Empress on the 9th of May,
1812, on his way to join the Grand Army then forming
on the Polish frontier, the imperial pair were accompanied
by a continual triumph. Not merely in France
but throughout Germany the ringing of bells, music and
the most enthusiastic greetings awaited them wherever
they appeared. On May 16th, the Emperor arrived at
Dresden where the Emperor of Austria, the Kings of
Prussia, Naples, Wirtemberg, and Westphalia and almost
every German sovereign of inferior rank had been invited
to meet him. He had sent to request the Czar also to
appear in this brilliant assemblage, as a last chance of an
amicable arrangement, but the messenger could not obtain
admission to Alexander's presence.</p>

<p>Marie Louise was now sent back to France and the
Russian campaign began. Marshal Ney, with one great
division of the army, had already passed the Vistula;
Junot, with another, occupied both sides of the Oder.
The Czar was known to be at Wilna, collecting the forces
of his immense Empire and entrusting the general arrangements
of the approaching campaign to Marshal Barclay
de Tolly, an officer who had been born and educated in
Germany. The season was advancing and it was time
that the question of peace or war should be forced to a
decision.</p>

<p>Napoleon, before leaving the gay court of Dresden,
where he was hailed as "the king of kings," dispatched
Count de Narbonne to the Emperor Alexander to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
a fresh attempt at negotiation in order to spare the shedding
of more blood. On his return Narbonne stated that
"he had found the Russians neither depressed nor boasting;
that the result of all the replies of the Czar was,
that they preferred war to a disgraceful peace; that they
would take special care not to risk a battle with an adversary
so formidable; and, finally, that they were determined
to make every sacrifice to protract the war, and
drive back the invader."</p>

<p>Napoleon arrived at Dantzic on the 7th of June, and
during the fortnight which ensued, it was known that the
final communications between him and Alexander were
taking place. On the 22nd the French Emperor broke
silence in a bulletin in which he said: "Soldiers, Russia
is dragged on by her fate; her destiny must be accomplished.
Let us march; let us cross the Niemen, let us
carry war into her territories. Our second campaign of
Poland will be as glorious as the first; but our second
peace shall carry with it its own guarantee. It shall put
an end forever to that haughty influence which Russia has
exercised for fifty years over the affairs of Europe."</p>

<p>The Czar announced the termination of the negotiations
by stating the innumerable efforts to obtain peace and concluded
in these words: "Soldiers, you fight for your
religion, your liberty and your native land. Your Emperor
is amongst you; and God is the enemy of the
aggressor."</p>

<p>Napoleon reviewed the greater part of his troops on the
battlefield of Friedland, and having assured them of still
more splendid victories over the same enemy, issued his
final orders to the chief officers of his army. The disposition
of his forces when the campaign commenced was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
as follows:&mdash;The left wing, commanded by Macdonald,
and amounting to 30,000 men, had orders to march through
Courland, with the view, if possible, of outflanking the
Russian right, and gaining the possession of sea coast
in the direction of Riga. The right wing, composed
almost wholly of Austrians, 30,000 in number, and commanded
by Schwartzenberg, was stationed on the Volhynian
frontier. Between these moved the various corps
forming the grand central army under the general superintendence
of Napoleon himself, viz., those of Davoust,
Ney, Jerome Bonaparte, Eugene Beauharnais, Prince
Poniatowski, Junot and Victor; and in numbers amounting
to 250,000 men. The communication of the centre and
the left was maintained by the corps of Oudinot, and those
of the centre and the extreme right by the corps of
Regnier, who had with him the Saxon auxiliaries and the
Polish legion of Dombrowski. The chief command of the
whole cavalry of the host was assigned to Murat who
was in person at the headquarters of the Emperor, having
immediately under his order three divisions of horse&mdash;those
of Grouchy, Montbrun and Nantousy. Augereau, with
his division was to remain in the north of Germany to
watch over Berlin and protect the communications with
France. Napoleon's base of operations, as will be seen by
the <ins title="No maps in this book.">map</ins>, extended over full one hundred leagues, and the
heads of his various columns were so distributed that the
Russians could not guess whether St. Petersburg or Moscow
formed the main object of his march.</p>

<p>The Russian army, under de Tolly, had its headquarters
at Wilna, and consisted, at the opening of the campaign,
of 120,000 men. Considerably to the left lay "the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
army," as it was called, of 80,000 men under Bagration
with whom were Platoff and 12,000 of his
Cossacks; while at the extreme of that wing, "the army
of Volhynia," 20,000 strong, commanded by Tormazoff,
watched Schwartzenberg. On the right of de Tolly was
Witgenstein with 30,000 men and between these again and
the sea, the corps of Essen 10,000 strong. Behind the
whole line two armies of reserve were rapidly forming
at Novogorod and Smolensk, each, probably, of about
20,000 men. The Russians actually in the field at the
opening of the campaign were, then, as nearly as can be
computed, 260,000; while Napoleon was prepared to
cross the Niemen at the head of 470,000 men.</p>

<p>The Czar was resolved from the beginning to act entirely
on the defensive and to draw Napoleon, if possible, into
the heart of his own country ere he gave him battle. The
various divisions of the Russian force had orders to fall
back leisurely as the enemy advanced, destroying whatever
they could not take with them, and halting
only at certain points where intrenched camps had already
been formed for their reception.</p>

<p>The difficulty of feeding half a million men in a country
deliberately wasted beforehand, and separated by so great
a space from Germany, to say nothing of France, was
sure to increase at every hour and every step. Alexander's
great object was, therefore, to husband his own
strength until the Polar winter should set in around the
strangers, and bring the miseries which he thus foresaw
to a crisis.</p>

<p>Napoleon, on the other hand, had calculated on being
met by the Russians at, or even in advance of their own
frontier, (as he had been by the Austrians in the campaign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
of Austerlitz and by the Prussians in that of Jena); of
gaining a great battle, marching immediately either to
St. Petersburg or Moscow, and dictating a peace within
the walls of one of the Czar's own palaces.</p>

<p>On June 24th the Grand Imperial Army, consolidated into
three masses, began their passage of the Niemen,&mdash;Jerome
Bonaparte at Grodno, Eugene at Pilony, and Napoleon
himself near Kowno. The Emperor rode on in front of
his army at two o'clock in the morning to reconnoitre the
banks, escaping observation by wearing a Polish cloak
and hat; his horse stumbled and he fell to the ground.
"A bad omen&mdash;a Roman would return," some one
remarked. After a minute investigation he discovered a
spot near the village of Poinemen, above Kowno, suitable
for the passage of his troops, and gave orders for three
bridges to be thrown across at nightfall. The first who
crossed the river were a few sappers in a boat. All was
deserted and silent on the foreign soil, and no one appeared
to oppose their proceedings with the exception of a single
armed Cossack, who asked, with an appearance of surprise,
who they were and what they wanted. "Frenchmen,"
was the reply; "we come to make war upon your Emperor;
to take Wilna, and deliver Poland."</p>

<p>The Cossack struck spurs into his horse and three French
soldiers discharged their pieces into the gloomy depths of
the woods, where they had lost sight of him, in token of
hostility. There came on at the same moment a tremendous
thunder storm. Thus began the fatal invasion.</p>

<p>The passage of the troops was impeded for a time; as the
bridge over the Vilia, a stream running into the Niemen, had
been broken by the Russians. The Emperor, however,
despising this obstacle, ordered a Polish squadron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
of horse to swim the river. They instantly obeyed; but
on reaching the middle the current proved too strong
for them, broke their ranks, and swept away and engulfed
many of them. Even during their last struggles the
brave fellows turned their faces towards the shore, where
Napoleon was watching their unavailing efforts with the
deepest emotion, and shouted with their dying breath,
"Vive l'Empereur!"</p>

<p>Three of these noble-spirited patriots uttered this cry
when only a part of their faces was above the waters.
The army was struck with a mixture of horror and admiration.
Napoleon watched the scene apparently unmoved,
but gave every order he could devise for the purpose of
saving as many of them as possible, though with little
effect. It is probable that his strongest feeling, even at
the time, was a presentiment that this disastrous event
was but the beginning of others, at once tremendous and
extensive.</p>

<p>As these enormous hosts advanced into the Russian
territory Alexander withdrew his armies as deliberately as
the invader pushed on. Wilna, the capital itself, was
evacuated two days before the French came in sight of it,
and Napoleon took up his quarters there on the 28th of
June. Here it was found that all the magazines, which
he counted on seizing, had been burnt before the
Russians withdrew. Already the imperial bulletins began
to denounce the "barbarous method" in which the enemy
resolved to conduct his defense.</p>

<p>Napoleon remained twenty days at Wilna during
which time he redoubled his efforts to secure quantities of
provisions which were to be conveyed along with his
army; these were to render him independent of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
countries through which he might pass. The destruction
of the magazines at Wilna reassured him that he had
judged well in departing from the old system of marauding,
which had been adopted in previous campaigns
with success. At the end of this period Napoleon
became aware that while the contracts entered into by his
war minister were adequate for the army's needs, the
handling of such enormous quantities of provisions, under
the most favorable circumstances, must be slow and in
some degree uncertain. Thus the Emperor found himself
under the necessity, either of laying aside his invasion for
another year, or of urging it in the face of every difficulty,
all of which he had forseen except the slowness of a
commissariat department.</p>

<p>When Napoleon arrived at Wilna, he was regarded by
the people as their liberator. A deputation was sent to
him by the Diet of Warsaw entreating his assistance
towards the restoration of their ancient kingdom, the
re-establishment of Poland having been proclaimed.
They came, they said, to solicit Napoleon the Great to
pronounce these few words: "Let the kingdom of Poland
exist!" and then it would exist; that all the Poles would
devote themselves to the orders of the fourth French
dynasty, to whom ages were but a moment, and space no
more than a point.</p>

<p>Napoleon's reply was not satisfactory, "In my position,
I have many interests to reconcile," he said "and many
duties to fulfill." His answer was so extremely guarded,
that the Poles became dissatisfied and offered little or no
support to the French. "Had Poland been regenerated"
says Bourrienne, "Napoleon would have found
the means of succeeding in his expedition. In his march<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
upon Moscow, his rear and supplies would have been
protected, and he would have secured that retreat which
subsequent reverses rendered but too needful."</p>

<p>During this delay Alexander was enabled to withdraw
the troops which he had been maintaining on the flanks
of his European domains and bring them all to the assistance
of his main army. The enthusiasm of the Russian
nation appeared in the extraordinary rapidity with which
supplies of every kind were poured at the feet of the Czar.
From every quarter he received voluntary offers of men,
money, and whatever might assist in the prosecution of
the war. The Grand Duchess Anne, whose hand Napoleon
had solicited, set the example by raising a regiment
on her estate. Platoff, the veteran hetman of the Cossacks,
promised his only daughter and 200,000 rubles to
the man by whose hand Napoleon should fall. Noblemen
everywhere raised troops, and displayed their patriotism
by serving in the ranks themselves and entrusting the
command to experienced officers chosen by the government.</p>

<p>Napoleon at length re-entered the field without having
done much to remedy the disorders of his commissariat.
He at first determined to make St. Petersburg his mark,
counting much on the effects which a triumphal entry
into the capital would produce throughout the country,
but his troops meeting with some reverses at Riga and
Dunaburg, he changed his plans and resolved to march on
Moscow instead.</p>

<p>The centre of the army was now thrown forward under
Davoust with the view of turning Barclay's position and
cutting off his communication with Bagration. This
brought about an engagement with the latter on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
23rd of July near Mohilow, the French remaining in
possession of the town. The Russian commander in
retreating informed Barclay that he was now marching,
not on Vitepsk, but on Smolensk.</p>

<p>During the three days of the 25th, 26th and 27th of
July the French were again victorious. Napoleon halted
at Vitepsk for several days in order to allow his troops to
recuperate. On the 8th of August the Emperor quitted
Vitepsk and after a partial engagement at Krasnoi on the
14th, came in sight of Smolensk on the 16th. On the
10th of August Napoleon was observed to write eight
letters to Davoust, and nearly as many to each of his
commanders. "If the enemy defends Smolensk" he said
in one of his letters to Davoust, "as I am tempted to
believe he will, we shall have a decisive engagement
there, and we cannot have too large a force. Orcha
will become the central point of the army. Everything
induces me to believe that there will be a great battle at
Smolensk."</p>

<p>The day on which the combat at Krasnoi was fought
happened to be the Emperor's birthday. There was no
intention of keeping it in these immense solitudes, and
under the present circumstances of peril and anxiety.
There could be no heartfelt festival without a complete
victory. Murat and Ney, however, on giving in the report
of their recent success, could not refrain from complimenting
the Emperor on the anniversary of his nativity.
A salute from a hundred pieces of artillery was now
heard,&mdash;fired according to their orders.</p>

<p>Napoleon, with a look of displeasure, observed, that in
Russia it was important to be economical of French
powder; but he was informed in reply, that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Russian powder, and had been taken the night before.
The idea of having his birthday celebrated at the expense
of the Russians made Napoleon smile.</p>

<p>Prince Eugene also paid his compliments to the Emperor
on this occasion, but was cut short by Napoleon saying,
"Everything is preparing for a battle. I will gain that,
and then we will see Moscow." Ségur says that Eugene
was heard to observe, on leaving the imperial tent,
"Moscow will destroy us!"</p>

<p>The first and second armies of the Czar, under Bagration
and Barclay, having at length effected a junction,
retired with 120,000 men behind the river which flows at
the back of this town.</p>

<p>As soon as Napoleon saw these masses of men approaching
from the distance he clapped his hands with joy,
exclaiming, "At last I have them!" The moment that
was to decide the fate of Russia or the French army, had
apparently arrived.</p>

<p>Napoleon passed along the line, and assigned to each
commander his station, leaving an extensive plain unoccupied
in front between himself and the Dneiper. This
he offered to the enemy as a field of battle, but instead of
accepting the challenge Barclay and Bagration were seen
next morning in full retreat.</p>

<p>During the night the Russian garrison had withdrawn
and joined the army across the river. Before they departed
they committed the city to flames, and, the buildings
being chiefly of wood, the conflagration, according to the
French bulletin, "resembling in its fury an eruption of
Vesuvius." "Never," said Napoleon, "was war conducted
with such inhumanity; the Russians treat their
own country as if it were that of an enemy." It now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
however, began to be difficult in the extreme to extinguish
the flames created by the retreating Russians. The
Emperor in person used every effort to stop the progress of
the devouring element and render succor to the wounded.
"Napoleon," says Gourgaud, "is of all generals, whether
ancient or modern, the one who has paid the greatest
attention to the wounded. The intoxication of victory
never could make him forget them, and his first thought,
after every battle, was always of them."</p>

<p>It was very evident that the Russian commander had no
desire that Napoleon should establish himself in winter
quarters at this point. From Smolensk the Russians
retreated to Dorogoburg, and thence to Viasma; halting
at each of these towns and deliberately burning them in
face of the enemy. Having returned to Smolensk, Napoleon
became a prey to the most harassing reflections on the
opportunity which had so lately escaped him of destroying
the whole of the Russian army, and attaining a speedy
conclusion of peace. Uncertainty began to gain ground
with him; vague presentiments made him desire to
terminate as soon as possible this distant campaign. "We
are too far engaged to fall back," said the Emperor on
arriving at Ougea; "and if I only proposed to myself
the glory of warlike exploits, I should have but to return
to Smolensk, there plant my eagles, and content myself
with extending my right and left arms which would
crush Witgenstein and Tormasoff. These operations
would be brilliant; they would finish the campaign very
satisfactorily, but they would not terminate the war. Our
troops may advance, but are incapable of remaining stationary,
motion may keep them together: a halt or retreat
would at once dissolve them. Ours is an army of attack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
not of defense; of operation, not of position. We must
advance upon Moscow, gain possession of that capital, and
there dictate terms of peace to the Czar! Peace is before
us; we are but eight days march from it; when the object
is so nearly attained, it would be unwise to deliberate.
Let us, therefore, march upon Moscow!"</p>

<p>At this period Barclay was appointed to the war ministry
at St. Petersburg, and Kutusoff, who assumed the
command in his stead, was beginning to doubt whether the
system of retreat had not been far enough persisted in.
Napoleon ordered a vigorous pursuit of the enemy, hoping
to come up with and crush him, before he could reach his
ancient capital. The honor of marching with the advance
guard devolved upon Marshal Ney, who gloriously justified
the confidence of Napoleon by the intelligence and
bravery which he displayed at the battle of Valoutina.
This was a most sanguinary fight. Four times were the
Russians driven from their positions, and on each occasion,
brought up reinforcements, and retook them; at length
they were finally overthrown by the valorous Gudin who
charged at the head of his division, the vigor and impetuosity
of which led the enemy to believe that they were
exposed to the shock of the Imperial Guard. Thirty
thousand men were brought into action on either side,
and the slaughter was terrible. Much individual bravery
was also displayed on this occasion. But for the failure
of Junot,&mdash;who had begun to show signs of approaching
insanity,&mdash;to faithfully execute his orders, the victory might
have been decisive. The Emperor was much gratified,
however, at the conduct of his troops at Valoutina. He
repaired in person to the field of battle and passed in review
the divers regiments which had distinguished themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
there. "Arrived at the 7th light infantry" says Gourgaud,
"he ordered the captains to advance, and said to
them, 'Show me the best officer of the regiment.' 'Sire,
they are all good&mdash;' 'that is no answer; come at least to
the conclusion of Themistocles; 'I am the first; the
second is my neighbor.'"</p>

<p>At length Captain Moncey, who was absent on account
of his wounds, was named. "What," said the Emperor,
"Moncey who was my page! the son of the marshal!
Seek another!" "Sire, he is the best." "Ah, well!"
said Napoleon, "I shall give him the decoration."</p>

<p>Up till this time the 127th regiment had marched without
an eagle, having had no opportunity of distinguishing
itself. The Imperial ensign was now delivered to it by
Napoleon's own hands.</p>

<p>The new Russian general at length resolved to comply
with the clamorous entreaties of his troops and fixed on a
strong position between Borodino and Moskowa on the
highroad to Moscow, where he determined to await the
attack of Napoleon who was pushing the war vigorously,
sword in hand, in the hopes of closing hostilities by one
pitched battle.</p>

<p>On the 5th of September Napoleon came in sight of the
position of Kutusoff and succeeded in carrying a redoubt
which had been erected to guard the high-road to Moscow.
This was effected at the bayonet point, though not without
great slaughter on either side.</p>

<p>The next day the two armies lay in presence of each other
preparing for a great contest. On the eve of, and before
daybreak on the 6th, the Emperor was on horseback,
wrapped in his gray coat, and exhibited all the alacrity of
his younger days. On his return to headquarters he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
found a courier had arrived with dispatches announcing
Marmont's defeat and the deliverance of Salamanca into
the hands of Wellington. M. de Beausset also arrived bringing
from Paris a portrait of Napoleon's son which deeply
moved the Emperor. He caused the picture to be placed
outside his tent where it was viewed by his officers. He
then said to his secretary, "Take it away, and guard it
carefully; he sees a field of battle too early."</p>

<p>The Russians were posted on an elevated plain; having
a wood on their right flank, their left on one of the
villages, and a deep ravine, the bed of a small stream, in
front. Extensive field-works covered every prominent
point of this naturally very strong ground; and in the
centre of the whole line, a gentle eminence was crowned
by an enormous battery, serving as a species of citadel.
The Russian army numbered about 120,000 men against
which were opposed almost an equal number of French
troops. In artillery, also, the armies were equal. The
Emperor fixed his headquarters in the redoubt whence he
had issued the order for battle in the morning; the elevation
of the ground permitted him to observe the greatest
part of the Russian line, and the various movements of the
enemy. The young guard and the cavalry were before
him, and the old guard in his rear.</p>

<p>Before the engagement Napoleon addressed his troops:
"Here is the battle you have looked for,"&mdash;he said, "for
it brings us plenty; good winter-quarters, and a safe
retreat to France. Behave yourselves so that posterity
may say of each of you,&mdash;'He was in that great battle
beneath the walls of Moscow.'"</p>

<p>At 4 o'clock on the morning of the 7th the French
advanced under cover of a thick fog, and assaulted at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
once the centre, the right, and the left of Kutusoff's
position. Such was the impetuosity of the charge that
they drove the Russians from their redoubts but this was
for a short time only as they rallied under every line of the
fire from the French, and instantly advanced. Russian
peasants who, till that hour, had never seen war, and
who still wore their usual rustic dress, distinguished only
by a cross sewed on it in front, threw themselves into the
thickest of the combat. As they fell, others rushed on
and filled their places. Some idea may be formed of the
obstinacy of the contest from the fact that one division of
the Russians which mustered 30,000 in the morning only
8,000 survived. These men had fought in close order,
and unshaken, under the fire of eighty pieces of artillery.
The Russians had the advantage of ground, of speaking
but one language, of one uniform, of being a single
nation, and fighting for the same cause. By 2 o'clock,
however, according to the imperial bulletin, all hope had
abandoned the enemy; the battle was at an end, although
the cannonade was not yet discontinued. The Russians
fought for their retreat and safety, but no longer for the
victory.</p>

<p>The result of this terrible day, in which the French
fired sixty-six thousand cannon balls, was that while the
Russians were defeated they were far from routed. "However
great may have been the success of this day," says
Ségur, "it might have been still more so if Napoleon,
instead of finishing the battle at 4 o'clock in the afternoon
had profited by the remainder of the day to bring
his Guard into the field, and thus changed the defeat of
the enemy into a complete rout."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>That the Emperor suffered intensely during the day is
well-known. He had passed a restless night and a violent
and incessant cough cut short his breathing.</p>

<p>As to his desire of preserving a reserve uninjured, and
forming it from a chosen and devoted body, such as his
Guard, Napoleon explained it to his marshals by saying:
"And if there should be a second battle tomorrow, what
could I oppose to it?"</p>

<p>General Gourgaud has added: "If the Guard had
been destroyed at the battle of Moskowa, the French
army, of which their guard constantly formed the core,
and whose courage it supported during the retreat, could
scarcely have ever repassed the Niemen."</p>

<p>This refusal of Napoleon to engage his Guard is generally
held to have been one of his greatest military lapses.
At the time they were demanded by Ney and others the
enemy was all but beaten and the appearance of the
Emperor at their head would in all probability have closed
the day with a great victory to his credit, and, according to
the opinions of many military men of this day, have ended
the Russian campaign by this one battle.</p>

<p>Night found either army on the ground they had occupied
at daybreak. The number of guns and prisoners
taken by the French and the Russians was about equal;
and of either host there had fallen not less than 40,000
men. Some accounts give the total number of the slain
as 100,000.</p>

<p>The Russian commander fought desperately but was at
last compelled to retire. His army was the mainstay of
the country and had it been destroyed, the Czar would
have found it difficult to form another. Having ascertained
then the extent of his loss and buried his dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
among whom was the gallant Bagration, the Russian
withdrew from his intrenchment and marched on Mojaisk.
Marshal Ney was rewarded for the noble share he had in
the success of this battle, by the title of Prince of the
Moskowa.</p>

<p>The small number of prisoners taken at Moskowa,&mdash;or
Borodino as the battle is frequently called,&mdash;the circumstance
of the Russians being able to carry away their
wounded, and many other considerations amply prove that
such another contest would have ruined Napoleon. The
Russians ordered <i>Te Deums</i> to be chanted at Moscow in
honor of what they termed a victory for themselves and
Napoleon sent similar instructions to his bishops in France.</p>

<p>Napoleon was so fortunate as to be joined exactly at this
time by two fresh divisions from Smolensk which nearly
restored his muster to what it had been when the battle
began, and thus reinforced commanded that the pursuit be
pushed. On the 9th the French vanguard came in sight
of the Russian rear again and Napoleon prepared for
battle but once more Kutusoff fled precipitately in the
direction of the capital.</p>

<p>The Emperor reached the "Hill of Salvation,"&mdash;so called
because from that eminence the Russian traveler obtains
his first view of the ancient metropolis affectionately called
"Mother Moscow," and hardly less sacred in his eyes than
Jerusalem. The soldiery beheld with joy and exultation
the magnificent extent of the place; its mixture of Gothic
steeples and oriental domes; and high over all the rest
the huge towers of the Kremlin, at once the palace and
citadel of the old Czars. The cry of "Moscow! Moscow!"
ran through the lines. Napoleon himself reined
in his horse, and exclaimed, "Behold, at last, that celebrated
city!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>It was soon observed that no smoke came from the
chimneys, and again, that no military appeared on the
battlements of the old walls and towers. Murat, who commanded
the van, now came riding up and informed the Emperor
that he had held a parley with Milarodowitch, general
of the Russian rear-guard, and that he had declared that
unless two hours were granted for the safe withdrawing of
his troops, he would at once set fire to Moscow. Napoleon
immediately granted the armistice. When the
Emperor halted at the barrier he had the exterior of the
city reconnoitred; Eugene was ordered to surround it on
the north, and Poniatowski to embrace the south, whilst
Davoust remained near the centre; the Guard was then
ordered to march, and, under the command of Lefebvre,
Napoleon entered Moscow, and prepared to establish
himself in the city. He found the capital deserted by
all but the very lowest and most wretched of its vast population.
The French soldiers soon spread themselves over
its innumerable streets filling the magnificent palaces, the
bazaars of the merchants, the churches, convents and public
buildings of every description. The meanest soldier
clothed himself in silk and furs and drank at his pleasure
the costliest wines. Napoleon, perplexed at the abandonment
of so great a city, had great difficulty in keeping
together 30,000 men under Murat, who followed Milarodowitch,
and watched the walls on that side.</p>

<p>At midnight the Emperor, who had retired to rest in a
suburban palace, was awakened by the cry of "Fire!"
The chief market-place was in flames and it was some
hours before it could be extinguished. While the fire still
burned Napoleon established his quarters in the Kremlin,
and wrote by that fatal light, a letter to the Czar, containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
proposals for peace. In his letter he assured the Czar,
"that whatever might be the vicissitudes of war, nothing
could diminish the esteem entertained for him by his friend
of Tilsit and Erfurt."</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Napoleon at the Battle of Freidland</span></div>
</div>

<p>The letter was committed to a prisoner of rank but no
answer was ever received to it. On the next day the
flames broke out again and in a short time various detached
parts of the city were in flames, combustibles and matches
were found in many places, and the water-pipes cut so that
attempts to control the spreading flames were almost useless.
The wind changed three times in the course of the
night and the flames always broke out again with new
vigor in the quarter from which the prevailing breeze blew
right on the Kremlin. It was now found that the governor,
in abandoning the city, had set all the malefactors
in the numerous jails at liberty.</p>

<p>For four days the fire continued with more or less fury
and four-fifths of the city was wholly consumed. "Palaces
and temples," says Karamsin the Russian author,
"monuments of arts and miracles of luxury, the remains
of ages long since past, and the creation of yesterday, the
tombs of ancestors, and the cradles of children were indiscriminately
destroyed. Nothing was left of Moscow save
the memory of her people, and their deep resolution to
avenge her fall."</p>

<p>On the third night the equinoctial gale arose, the Kremlin
itself, from which point Napoleon had witnessed the
spread of this fearful devastation, took fire and it became
doubtful whether it would be possible for the Emperor to
withdraw in safety.</p>

<p>About 4 o'clock in the morning, one of Napoleon's
officers awoke him, to inform him of the conflagration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
He had thrown himself on the bed only a few minutes
before, after having dictated orders to the various corps
of his army, and labored with his secretaries. He watched
from the windows the course of the fire which devoured
his fair conquest, and the exclamation burst from him:
"This is then how they make war! The civilization of St.
Petersburg has deceived us; they are indeed Scythians!"</p>

<p>During several hours he remained immovable at the
Kremlin. The palace was now surrounded by the flames
and he consented to be conducted out of the city. He
rode out through streets in many parts arched over with
flames, and buried, where this was not the case, in one
dense mantle of smoke. "It was then" says Ségur,
"that we met the Prince of Eckmuhl (Davoust). This
marshal, who had been wounded at the Moskowa, had
desired to be carried back among the flames to rescue
Napoleon, or to perish with him. He threw himself into
his arms with transport; the Emperor received him kindly,
but with that composure which in danger he never lost
for a moment."</p>

<p>"Not even the fictions of the burning of Troy" said
the Emperor, "though heightened by all the powers of
poetry, could have equalled the destruction of Moscow."</p>

<p>It was in the afternoon of the 16th that Napoleon left
Moscow and before nightfall had reached Petrowsky, a
country palace of the Czar, about a league distant, and
where he fixed his headquarters.</p>

<p>On the 20th, the flames being at length subdued, or
exhausted, Napoleon returned to the Kremlin still hoping
that the Czar would relent on learning of the destruction
of his ancient and sacred metropolis. Day after day passed
and still there came no answer from Alexander. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
Emperor's position was becoming hourly more critical.
On every side there was danger; the whole forces of Russia
appeared to be gathering around him. Then, too, the
season was far advanced; the stern winter of the North
was at hand and the determined hostility of the peasants
prevented the smallest supplies of provisions from being
introduced into the capital.</p>

<p>Daru advised the Emperor to draw in all his detachments,
convert Moscow into an intrenched camp, kill and
salt every horse, and trust to foraging parties for the rest&mdash;in
a word to lay aside all thoughts of keeping up communication
with France, or Germany, or even Poland;
and issue forth from Moscow, with his army entire and
refreshed, in the commencement of the Spring. But
Napoleon feared, and not without reason, that were he
and his army cut off from all communication, during six
months, the Prussians and the Austrians might throw off
the yoke; while, on the other hand, the Russians could
hardly fail, in the course of so many months, to accumulate,
in their own country, a force before which his isolated
army, on re-issuing from their winter quarters would
appear but a mere speck.</p>

<p>Another letter was now sent by Napoleon to the headquarters
of Kutusoff for Alexander. Count Lauriston
was received by the commander in the midst of his generals
and answered with such civility that the envoy doubted not
of success. In the end, however, he was informed that
no negotiations could be entertained and he declared his
inability to even sanction the journey of any French messenger
to St. Petersburg, without the authorization of his
master. Kutusoff offered, finally, to send Napoleon's
letter by one of his own aides-de-camp, and to this Lauriston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
was obliged to agree. The interview occurred on the
6th of October; no answer could be expected before the
20th. There had already been one fall of snow, and the
dangers attendant on a longer sojourn in the ruined capital
were increasing every hour.</p>

<p>It was under such circumstances that Napoleon lingered
on in the Kremlin until the 19th of October when he
decided to depart from Moscow. That evening several
divisions were put in motion and the metropolis was
wholly evacuated on the morning of the 22nd. This
sudden departure was due in part to Murat's engagement
with Bennigsen at Vincovo on the 18th, the day on which
the suspension of arms expired, causing him to lose 3,000
prisoners and forty pieces of artillery. General Milarodowitch,
during a conversation with Murat a few days
before, talked very frankly of the situation. Murat looked
upon peace as indispensable to Russia, and was enlarging
upon "the continued success of the French" and having
opened for them the gates of Moscow. "Yes General,"
replied Milarodowitch, briskly, "the campaign is over
with the French, and it is now time it should commence
with the Russians."</p>

<p>On the 19th of October the Emperor with 6,000 chosen
horse began his journey towards Smolensk, the care of
bringing up the main body being given to Eugene Beauharnais,
while Ney commanded the rear.</p>

<p>As Napoleon left Moscow he said to Mortier: "Pay
every attention to the sick and wounded. Sacrifice your
baggage,&mdash;everything to them. Let the wagons be
devoted to their use, and, if necessary your own saddles.
This was the course I pursued at St. Jean d' Acre. The
officers will first relinquish their horses, then the sub-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>officers,
and finally the men. Assemble the generals and
officers under your command, and make them sensible
how necessary, in their circumstances, is humanity. The
Romans bestowed civic crowns on those who preserved
their citizens; I shall not be less grateful."</p>

<p>From the commencement of this march hardly a day
elapsed in which some new calamity did not befall those
hitherto invincible legions. The Cossacks of Platoff
came upon one division at Kolotsk, near Borodino, on the
1st of November, and gave them a total defeat. A second
division was attacked the day after and with nearly equal
success, by the irregular troops of Count Orloff Denizoff.
The French now became separated by attacks made by
Milarodowitch and the soldiers began to suffer from
extreme hunger. On the 6th of November their miseries
were heightened by the setting in of the Russian winter.
Thenceforth, between the heavy columns of regular troops
which on every side watched and threatened them, the
continued assaults of the Cossacks who hung around them
in clouds by day and by night, rushing on every detached
party like the Mamelukes of Egypt, disturbing every
bivouac, breaking up bridges before, and destroying
every straggler behind them, to the terrible severity of
the climate, the frost, the snow, the wind&mdash;the sufferings
of this once magnificent army were such as have hardly
been equalled in the world's history.</p>

<p>The enormous train of artillery which Napoleon brought
from Moscow was soon diminished and the roads were
blocked up with the spoils of the city, abandoned of
necessity, as the means of transport failed. The horses,
having been ill-fed for months, were altogether unable to
resist the united effects of cold and fatigue. They sank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
and stiffened by hundreds and by thousands. The starving
soldiery slew others of these animals that they might
drink their warm blood and wrap themselves in their yet
reeking skins! All discipline had vanished.</p>

<p>They were able to keep together some battalions of the
rear-guard, and present a bold aspect to the pursuers, the
heroic Marshal Ney not disdaining to bear a firelock,
and share the meanest fatigues of his brave followers.</p>

<p>The main Russian army, having advanced side by side
with the French, was now stationed to the southwest of
Smolensk, in readiness to break the enemy's march
whenever Kutusoff should choose. Milarodowitch and
Platoff were hanging close behind, and thinning every
hour the miserable bands which had no longer heart, nor,
for the most part, arms of any kind wherewith to resist
them. All the reports brought to headquarters by the
officers, represented Kutusoff as disposed to oppose the
French army and risk a battle, rather than abandon his
positions which were on the road he wished to close
against the continued retreat of the Emperor. Napoleon
was not convinced by these reports. At daybreak,
mounted on horseback, he started out to reconnoitre the
camp and disposition of the enemy who was preparing to
dispute Kalouga. As the Emperor arrived near Malojaroslawetz
a body of Cossacks was seen approaching.
Napoleon and his escort prepared to defend themselves.
Rapp had scarcely time to seize his chief's bridle and
say, "It is the Cossacks, turn back!" ere a fierce band
galloped towards them. The Emperor, scorning flight,
drew his sword, and reigned his horse to the side of the
road. The troop dashed past wounding Rapp and his
horse. "When Napoleon saw my horse covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
blood," says Rapp in his "Memoirs," "he demanded if I
had been wounded. I replied that I had come off with a few
bruises, upon which he began to laugh at our adventure,
although I, for my part, found it anything but amusing."
The appearance of Marshal Bessieres, who arrived at
the head of some squadrons of grenadiers of the Guard,
sufficed to stay the disorder and put the Cossacks to flight.</p>

<p>The Grand Army had mustered 120,000 men when it left
Moscow. Including the fragments of various divisions
which met the Emperor at Smolensk it was with great
difficulty that 40,000 men could now be brought together
in anything like fighting condition. These Napoleon
divided into four columns, nearly equal in numbers; of
the first which included 6,000 of the Imperial Guard, he
himself took the command, and marched with it towards
Krasnoi. The second corps was that of Eugene Beauharnais;
the third Davoust's; and the fourth destined for
the perilous service of the rear, and accordingly strengthened
with 3,000 of the Guard, was intrusted to the guidance
of Marshal Ney.</p>

<p>Eugene and Ney at length entered Smolensk. The
name of that town had hitherto been the only spell that
preserved any hope within the soldiers of the retreat.
There, they had been told, they should find food, clothing,
and supplies of all kinds, and there being once more
assembled under the eye of Napoleon, speedily reassume
an aspect such as none of the northern barbarians would
dare to brave.</p>

<p>These expectations were far from realized. Smolensk
had been almost entirely destroyed by the Russians in the
early part of the campaign. Its ruined walls afforded
only a scant shelter to the famished and shivering fugitives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
and the provisions assembled there were so inadequate
to the demands of the troops, that after the lapse of
a few days Napoleon found himself under the necessity of
once more renewing his disastrous march. While at
Smolensk Napoleon received dispatches from France,
informing him that a false report of his death had occasioned
an outbreak and which threatened for a brief period
the colossal Empire he controlled. On receiving the news
he exclaimed, with deep feeling, and in the presence of his
generals: "Does my power then, hang on so slender a
thread? Is my tenure of sovereignty so frail that a single
person can place it in jeopardy? Truly my crown is but
ill-fitted to my head if, in my very capital, the audacious
attempt of two or three adventurers can make it totter.
After twelve years of government,&mdash;after my marriage&mdash;after
the birth of my son&mdash;after my oaths&mdash;my death
would have again plunged the country into the midst of
revolutionary horrors. And Napoleon II., was he no
longer thought of?"</p>

<p>Napoleon left Smolensk on the 13th of November, 1812,
having ordered that the other corps should follow him on
the 14th, 15th and 16th respectively thus interposing a
day's march between every two divisions.</p>

<p>It seems to be generally accepted that the name of
Napoleon saved whatever part of his host finally escaped
from the territory of Russia. Kutusoff appears to have
exhausted the better part of his daring at Borodino and
thenceforth adhered to the plan of avoiding battle. He
seems to have been unable to again shake off that awe
which had been the growth of a hundred of Napoleon's
victories;&mdash;had he been able to do so the Emperor would
probably have died on some battlefield between Smolensk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
and the Beresina, or been taken a prisoner in the country
which three months before he had invaded at the head of
half a million of men. The army of Napoleon had been
already reduced to a very small fragment of its original
strength, and even that fragment was now split into four
divisions against any one of which it would have been
easy to concentrate a force overwhelmingly superior.</p>

<p>The Emperor reached Krasnoi unmolested although the
whole of the Russian army, moving on a parallel road,
were in full observation of his march; Eugene, who
followed him, was, however, intercepted on his way by
Milarodowitch, and after sustaining the contest gallantly
against very disproportionate numbers, and a terrible
cannonade, was at length saved only by the fall of night.
During the darkness Eugene executed a long and hazardous
<i>detour</i>, and joined the Emperor at Krasnoi on the 17th;
the two leading divisions now united, mustered scarcely
15,000 men. It was then thought advisable to await the
arrival of Davoust's and Ney's divisions before proceeding.
Kutusoff was again urged to seize this opportunity of
pouring an irresistible force on the French position, and
although he thinned the ranks of the enemy with 100
pieces of artillery well placed, he ventured on no closer
collision than one or two isolated cavalry charges. Napoleon,
therefore, held his ground in face of all that host,
until nightfall, when Davoust's division, surrounded and
pursued by innumerable Cossacks, at length was enabled
to rally once more around his headquarters. Ney, however
was still at Smolensk.</p>

<p>The Emperor now pushed on to relieve Eugene who
was in command of the van with orders to march on Liady
and secure the passage of the Dneiper at that point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>Davoust and Mortier were left at Krasnoi with orders
to hold out as long as possible in the hope of being there
joined by Ney. Long, however, before that gallant leader
could reach this point, the Russians, as if the absence of
Napoleon had at once restored all their energy, rushed
down and forced on Davoust and Mortier the battle which
Napoleon had in vain solicited. On that fatal field the
French left forty-five cannon and 6,000 prisoners, besides
the slain and wounded. The remainder with difficulty
effected their escape to Liady, where Napoleon once more
received them, and crossed the Dneiper.</p>

<p>Ney, meanwhile, having as directed by the Emperor,
blown up whatever remained of the walls and towers of
Smolensk, at length set his rear-guard in motion and
advanced to Krasnoi, without being harassed by any except
Platoff whose Cossacks entered Smolensk ere he could
wholly abandon it. Ney continued to advance on the
footsteps of those who had thus shattered Davoust and
Mortier and met with no considerable interruption until
he reached the ravine in which the rivulet Losmina has
its channel. A thick mist lay on the ground and Ney
was almost on the brink of the ravine before he perceived
that it was manned throughout by Russians, while the
opposite banks displayed a long line of batteries deliberately
arranged, and all the hills behind covered with
troops.</p>

<p>A Russian officer appeared and summoned Ney to surrender.
"A Marshal of France never surrenders!" was
his intrepid answer, and immediately the batteries, distant
only two hundred and fifty yards, opened a tremendous
storm of grape-shot. Ney, nevertheless, had the hardihood
to plunge into the ravine, clear a passage over the stream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
and charge the Russians at their arms. His small band
was repelled with fearful slaughter; but he renewed his
efforts from time to time during the day, and at night,
though with numbers much diminished, still occupied his
original position in the face of a whole army interposed
between him and Napoleon. The Emperor had by this
time given up all hopes of ever again seeing anything of
his rear column.</p>

<p>During the ensuing night Ney effected his escape&mdash;an
escape so miraculous that the history of war can scarcely
furnish a parallel. The marshal broke up his bivouac
at midnight, and marched back from the Losmina, until
he came on another stream, which he concluded must
also flow into the river Dneiper. He followed this
guide, and at length reached the great river at a place
where it was frozen over, though so thinly, that the ice
bent and cracked beneath the feet of the men who crossed
it in single files. The wagons laden with the wounded,
and what great guns were still with Ney, were too heavy
for this frail bridge. They attempted the passage at
different points, and one after another went down, amid
the shrieks of the dying and the groans of the onlookers.</p>

<p>The Cossacks had by this time gathered hard behind,
and swept up many stragglers, besides the sick. But Ney
had achieved his great object; and on the 20th of November
he, with his small and devoted band of 1500 men, joined
the Emperor once more at Orcha. Napoleon, on seeing
him received him in his arms, and exclaimed, "What a
man! What a soldier!" He could not find words to
express the admiration which the intrepid marshal had
inspired him with; he hailed him as "the bravest of the
brave" and declared with transport: "I have two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
hundred millions (of francs) in the cellars of the Tuileries,
and I would have given them all to save Marshal Ney!"</p>

<p>The Emperor was once more at the head of his united
"grand army"&mdash;a sad remnant of its former glory and
power. Between Smolensk and the Dneiper the Russians
had taken 228 guns, and 26,000 prisoners. At leaving
Smolensk Napoleon had mustered 40,000 effective men&mdash;he
now could count only 12,000, after Ney joined him at
Orcha. Of these there were but one hundred and fifty
cavalry; and, to remedy this defect, officers still in possession
of horses, to the number of 500, were now formed
into a "sacred band," as it was called, commanded by
General Grouchy, under Murat, for immediate attendance
upon the Emperor's person.</p>

<p>The Russians were now uniting all their forces for the
defense of the next great river on Napoleon's route,&mdash;the
Beresina. The Emperor had hardly resolved to cross this
river at Borizoff, ere, to renew all perplexities, he received
intelligence that by a combat with Dombrowski there the
enemy had retained possession of the town and bridge.
Victor and Oudinot advanced immediately to succor Dombrowski
and retook Borizoff; but the Russians burned
the bridge before re-crossing the Beresina.</p>

<p>Napoleon now decided to pass the Beresina higher
up, at Studzianska, and forthwith threw himself into
the huge forests which border the river, adopting every
stratagem by which his enemies could be puzzled
as to the immediate object of his march. His 12,000 brave
and determined men were winding their way amidst these
dark woods, when suddenly the air around them was
filled with sounds which could only proceed from the
march of some far greater host. They were preparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
for the worst when they found themselves in the presence
of the advanced guard of the united army of Victor and
Oudinot, who, although they had been defeated by Witgenstein,
still mustered 50,000 men, completely equipped
and hardly shaken in discipline.</p>

<p>Napoleon now continued his march on Studzianska,
employing, however, all his wit to confirm the belief
among the Russians that he meant to pass the Beresina at
a different place, and this with so much success that the
Russian rear-guard abandoned a strong position commanding
the river, during the very night which preceded
the Emperor's appearance there.</p>

<p>Two bridges were erected, and Oudinot had passed over
before Tchaplitz, in command of the Russian rear-guard,
perceived his mistake, and returned again toward Studzianska.
Discovering that the passage had already begun,
and that in consequence of the narrowness of the only two
bridges, it must needs proceed slowly, Tchichagoff and
Witgenstein now arranged a joint plan of attack. Platoff
and his indefatigable Cossacks joined Witgenstein arriving
long before the rear-guard of Napoleon could pass the
river. The French that had made the passage were
attacked by Tchaplitz, and being repelled by Oudinot left
them in unmolested possession, not only of the bridges on
the Beresina, but of a long train of wooden causeways
extending for miles beyond the river over deep and dangerous
morasses which but a few sparks were needed to
ignite and destroy.</p>

<p>Victor with the rear division, consisting of 8,000 men,
was still on the eastern side when Witgenstein and
Platoff appeared on the heights. The still numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
retainers of the camp, crowds of sick, wounded, and
women, and the greater part of the artillery were in the
same situation.</p>

<p>When the Russian cannon began to open upon this
multitude, crammed together near the bank, and each
anxiously expecting the turn to pass, a shriek of utter
terror ran through them, and men, women, horses and
wagons rushed pell-mell upon the bridges. The larger
of these, intended solely for wagons and cannon, ere long
broke down precipitating all that were upon it into the
dark and half-frozen stream. "The scream that arose at
this moment," says one that heard it, "did not leave my
ears for weeks; it was heard clear and loud over the hurrahs
of the Cossacks, and all the roar of artillery."</p>

<p>The remaining bridge was now the only resource, and
all indiscriminately endeavored to gain a footing on it;
exposed to the incessant shower of Russian cannonade
they fell and died in thousands. Victor stood his ground
bravely until late in the evening, and then conducted his
division over the bridge. Behind was left a great number
of the irregular attendants besides those soldiers who had
been wounded during the battle, and guns and baggage-carts
in great quantities. The French now fired the
bridge and all those were abandoned to their fate. The
Russian account states that when the Beresina broke up
in the Spring 36,000 bodies were found in the bed of the
river.</p>

<p>On the 3d of December Napoleon reached Morghoni,
and announced to his marshals that the news he had
received from Paris at Smolensk concerning Mallet's
attempt to overthrow his government by announcing the
death of the Emperor, and the uncertain relations with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
some of his allies, rendered it indispensable for him to
quit his army without further delay and return to Paris
with all possible speed. They were now, he said, almost
within sight of Poland; they would find plenty of everything
at Wilna. It was his business to prepare at home
the means of opening the next campaign in a manner
worthy of the great nation.</p>

<p>At Morghoni, on the 5th, the garrison at Wilna met
the Emperor and then, having intrusted to these fresh
troops, the protection of the rear, and given the chief
command to Murat, he finally bade adieu to the rulers of
his host. He set off in a sledge at midnight, accompanied
by Caulaincourt, whose name he assumed. Having
narrowly escaped being taken by a party of irregular
Russians at Youpranoni, the Emperor reached Warsaw at
nightfall on the 10th of December. Here he met his
ambassador, the Abbé de Pradt, to whom he said, "I
quit my army with regret; but I must watch Austria and
Prussia, and I have more weight on my throne than at
headquarters. The Russians will be rendered fool-hardy
by their successes. I shall beat them in a battle or two
on the Oder, and be on the Niemen again within a month&mdash;Monsieur
L'Ambassadeur, from the sublime to the
ridiculous there is but a step."</p>

<p>Resuming his journey, Napoleon reached Dresden on
the evening of the 14th of December, where the King of
Saxony visited him, and reassured him of his fidelity.
He then resumed the road to his capital and arrived at the
Tuileries on the 18th, late at night, after the Empress
had retired.</p>

<p>The remnant of the Grand Army meanwhile moved on
towards France in straggling columns. They passed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
Niemen at Kowno, and the Russians did not pursue them
into Prussian territory. Here about 1000 men in arms,
and perhaps 20,000 more utterly demoralized, were received
with compassion. They took up their quarters and
remained for a time unmolested, in and near Konigsberg.
The French army crossed the Niemen on the ice, on the
13th of December, defended still by Ney, who had to fight
with the Russians in Kowno. He now fought at the
head of only thirty men and was the last individual of the
French army who left Russian territory, as he did so he
threw his musket into the river defying the enemy with
his last breath. When he came up with General Dumas
in Prussian Poland he was scarcely recognizable, and on
being asked who he was replied, with eyes red and glaring,
"I am the rear-guard of the Grand Army; I have fired
the last musket shot on the bridge of Kowno!"</p>

<p>The few who survived all these horrors, men who had
fought in all Napoleon's campaigns, and wore the cross of
the Legion of Honor on their breasts, were now so wasted
with famine that they wept when they saw a loaf of
bread!</p>

<p>The total loss in this terrible campaign was somewhere
near 450,000 men; fatigue, hunger and cold had caused
the death of 132,000; and the Russians had taken
prisoners of 193,000&mdash;including forty-eight generals and
three thousand regimental officers. The eagles and standards
left in the enemy's hands were seventy-five in number
and the pieces of cannon nearly one thousand.</p>

THE CAMPAIGN OF 1813</h2>

<p class="p2">To the premature cold, and burning of Moscow, Napoleon
attributed the failure of his campaign in Russia.
His arrival at the Tuileries had been preceded by the 29th
bulletin in which the fatal events of the campaign were
fully and graphically recited. While he had not
been able to conquer the elements he found the Senate and
all the public bodies full of adulation and willingness to obey
his commands. However, what had been foreseen by almost
every person of discernment, except Napoleon, soon followed,
viz., an alliance against France by Prussia, Russia
and Austria.</p>

<p>New conscriptions were now called for and yielded;
regiments arrived from Spain and Italy; every arsenal
resounded with the preparation of new artillery. "The
wonderful energies of Napoleon's mind," says Scott, "and
the influence which he could exert over the minds of
others, were never so striking as at this period of his
reign. He had returned to the seat of his Empire at a
dreadful crisis, and in a most calamitous condition. His
subjects had been ignorant for three weeks whether he
was dead or alive. When he arrived it was to declare a
dreadful catastrophe. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Yet Napoleon came, and
seemed but to stamp on the earth, and armed legions
arose at his call: the doubts and discontents of the public
disappeared as mists at sunrising, and the same confidence
which had attended his prosperous fortunes, revived in its
full extent, despite of his late reverses."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>Ere many weeks had elapsed Napoleon found himself
once more in a condition to take the field with not less
than 350,000 soldiers. Such was the effect of his new
appeal to the national feelings of the French people.
Meanwhile the French garrisons dispersed over the Prussian
territory were wholly incompetent to overawe a nation
which thirsted for vengeance. The king endeavored to
protect Napoleon's soldiers but it soon became manifest
that their safety must depend on their concentrating themselves
in a small number of fortified towns. Murat now
resigned command of the troops, being succeeded by
Eugene Beauharnais who had the full confidence of the
Emperor. The new commander found that Frederick
William could no longer, even if he would, repress the
universal enthusiasm of the Prussians who were clamorous
for war. On the 31st of January, 1813, the king
made his escape to Breslau, in which neighborhood no
French were garrisoned, erected his standard and called
on the nation to rise in arms. Eugene, thereupon,
retired to Magdeburg and shut himself up in that great
fortress, with as many of the troops as he could assemble
to the west of the Elbe. When Napoleon heard that
Prussia had declared war against France he said with
perfect calmness, "It is better to have a declared
enemy, than a doubtful ally."</p>

<p>It was now six years since the fatal day of Jena, and in
spite of all of Napoleon's watchfulness the Prussian nation
had recovered, in a great measure, its energies. The
people answered the call as with the heart and voice of
one man. Youths of all ranks, the highest and the lowest,
flocked indiscriminately to the standard. The women
poured their trinkets into the king's treasure, the gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>men
melted their plate,&mdash;England poured in her gold with
a lavish hand. The thunder of the cannon of the Beresina
had raised the hopes of the House of Bourbon until
Louis XVIII. finally caused to be published in England,
and distributed throughout the Continent, a proclamation
in which he addressed himself to the people adroitly supporting
the common opinion which attributed to Napoleon
the prolongation of the war, and promising, among other
things, "to abolish the conscription."</p>

<p>The Emperor of Russia was no sooner aware of this
great movement, than he resolved to advance into Silesia.
Having masked several French garrisons in Prussian
Poland, and taken others, he pushed on with his main
army to support Frederick William. Evidently he did
not intend to permit the Prussians to stand alone the first
onset of Napoleon, of whose extensive arrangements all
Europe was aware.</p>

<p>The two sovereigns met at Breslau on the 15th of March.
Tears rushed down the cheeks of Frederick William, as
he fell into the arms of Alexander; "Wipe them," said
the Czar; "they are the last that Napoleon shall ever
cause you to shed."</p>

<p>The aged Kutusoff having died, the command of the
Russian army was now given to Witgenstein; while that
of the Prussians was intrusted to Blucher, an officer who
had originally trained under the great Frederick and who,
since the battle of Jena, had lived in retirement. The
soldiers had long before bestowed on him the title "Marshal
Forwards" and they heard of his appointment with
delight. Blucher hated the very names of France and
Bonaparte, and once more permitted to draw his sword,
he swore never to sheathe it until the revenge of Prussia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
was complete. Bernadotte, now the Crown Prince of
Sweden, and an ingrate,&mdash;owing not only his position but
his very existence to Napoleon,&mdash;now landed at Stralsund,
and advanced through Mecklenburg while the sovereigns
of Russia and Prussia were concentrating their armies in
Silesia. It was announced and expected that German
troops would join Bernadotte, so as to enable him to open
the campaign on the lower Elbe with a separate army of
100,000 men. Wellington, too, was about to advance once
more into Spain with his victorious armies. Three great
armies, two of which might easily communicate with each
other, were thus taking the field against Napoleon at
once.</p>

<p>Ere the Emperor once more left Paris, he named Marie
Louise Empress-Regent of France in his absence. As
the time approached when he was expected to assume
the command of his army in the field his devoted
subjects again and again expressed their loyalty to him
and to France. He quitted Paris in the middle of April.</p>

<p>On starting to join his youthful and inexperienced army
at Erfurt, Napoleon said, "I envy the lot of the meanest
peasant in my dominion. At my age he has fulfilled his
duties to his country, and he may remain at home, enjoying
the society of his wife and children; while I&mdash;I must
fly to the camp and engage in the strife of war. Such is
my fate."</p>

<p>"My good Louise" he said at the same time, "is
gentle and submissive, I can trust her. Her love and
fidelity for me will never fail(!). In the current of events
there may arise circumstances which decide the fate of an
Empire. In that case I hope the daughter of the Cæsars
will be inspired by the spirit of her grand-mother, Maria
Theresa."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>In three months an army of 350,000 men was raised,
equipped and brought together, and General Ségur says:
"At any hour of the day or night the Emperor, whatever
he was doing, could have told the numbers, the composition,
the strength of every one of the thousands of detachments
of every branch of the service which he set in
movement from every part of the Empire, the way they
were uniformed or equipped, the number of marches each
one had to make, the day, the place, even the hour at
which each was to arrive."</p>

<p>On the 18th he reached the banks of the Saale where
the troops he had been mustering and organizing in
France had now been joined by Eugene and the garrison
of Magdeburg.</p>

<p>The Czar and his Prussian ally were known to be at
Dresden, and it soon appeared that, while they meditated
a march westwards on Leipsic, the French intended to
move eastward with a view of securing the possession of
that great city. He had a host nearly 200,000 strong
concentrating for action while reserves of almost equal
numbers were gradually forming behind him on the
Rhine. Napoleon arrived at Erfurt on the 23d of April,
whilst Marshal Ney was taking possession of Weissenfels,
after a contest which caused him to say "he had never
at any one time, seen so much enthusiasm and <i>sang froid</i>
in the infantry." And yet the veterans of Austerlitz,
Jena, Friedland and Wagram had nearly all disappeared
from the ranks, and the honor of those eagles, so long
victorious, had been committed to young conscripts,
hardly conversant with their exercise, and by no means
habituated to the fatigues of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>The armies met on the first of May,&mdash;sooner than Napoleon
had ventured to hope,&mdash;near the town of Lutzen, then
celebrated as the scene of the battle in which King Gustavus
Adolphus died. The evening before the battle
Marshal Bessieres was forcing a defile near Poserna, and
having, according to custom, advanced into the very
midst of the skirmishers, a musket-ball struck him in the
breast, and extended him lifeless on the ground. His
death was concealed from the brave men he had so long
commanded and by whom he was greatly beloved,
until after the victory of the following day.</p>

<p>The allies crossed the Elster suddenly, under the cover
of a thick morning fog, and attacked the left flank of the
French, who had been advancing in column, and who
thus commenced the action under heavy disadvantages.
But the Emperor so skillfully altered the arrangement of
his army, that, ere the day closed, the allies were more
afraid of being enclosed to their ruin within his two wings,
than hopeful of being able to cut through and destroy
that part of his force which they had originally charged
and weakened, and which had now become his centre.</p>

<p>Night interrupted the conflict and the next morning
the enemy retreated, leaving Napoleon in possession of
the field. His victory was less complete than was desirable
although he lost but ten or twelve thousand men
while the allies lost above twenty thousand.</p>

<p>A great moral effect was, however, produced by the
battle. Napoleon, who had been regarded as already conquered,
was again victorious. The Emperor immediately
sent dispatches to every court in alliance with France, to
announce the event. "In my young soldiers," he said,
"I have found all the valor of my old companions-in-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>arms.
During the twenty years that I have commanded
the French troops I have never witnessed more bravery
and devotion. If all the Allied Sovereigns, and the ministers
who direct their cabinets, had been present on the
field of battle, they would have renounced the vain hope
of causing the Star of France to decline."</p>

<p>Beaten at Lutzen, Alexander and the King of Prussia
fell back on Leipsic, thence on Dresden, and finally
across the Elbe to Bautzen. A want of cavalry prevented
their pursuit.</p>

<p>Napoleon entered Dresden on the 11th of May, and on
the 12th was joined by the King of Saxony who still
adhered to him. The Saxon troops once more decided to
act in concert with the French. As Napoleon approached
Dresden, he was waited upon by the magistrates who had
been treacherous to him and to their king, and had welcomed
the allies.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" Napoleon asked severely.</p>

<p>"Members of the municipality," replied the trembling
burgomasters.</p>

<p>"Have you bread for my troops?" inquired Napoleon.</p>

<p>"Our resources," they answered, "have been entirely
exhausted by the requisitions of the Russians and
Prussians."</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied Napoleon, "it is impossible, is it? I
know no such word. Get ready bread, meat and wine.
You richly deserve to be treated as a conquered people.
But I forgive all from regard for your king. He is the
saviour of your country. You have been already punished
by the presence of the Russians and Prussians, and having
been governed by Baron Stein."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>On becoming master of Dresden, the Emperor, as usual,
sent proposals of a pacific nature to the allies, suggesting
that a general congress should assemble at Prague to treat
for peace. Neither Russia nor Prussia, however, would
listen favorably to what they considered would be an
admission of their incapacity to realize their boast of
speedily dethroning "the scourge and tyrant of Europe
and mankind."</p>

<p>Austria had been sounded, and expressed her willingness
to join the coalition on the first favorable opportunity.
She was at this time increasing her military establishment
largely, and a great body of troops was already
concentrated behind the mountainous frontier of Bohemia.
Austria, therefore, was enabled to turn the scale on
whichever side she might choose.</p>

<p>Napoleon now determined to crush the army which had
retreated from Lutzen, ere the ceremonious cabinet of
Vienna should have time to come to a distinct understanding
with the headquarters of Alexander and Frederick
William. That victory was the best method of securing
Austria's help, Napoleon clearly saw.</p>

<p>The allies, on their retreat, had blown up the magnificent
bridge over the Elbe at Dresden, and this being
replaced in part by some arches of wood, Napoleon now
moved towards Bautzen and came in sight of the enemy
on the morning of the 21st of May. The position of the
allies was almost perfect: in their front was the river
Spree; wooded hills supported their right, and eminences
well fortified their left.</p>

<p>The action began with an attempt to turn their right,
but Barclay de Tolly anticipated this movement and
repelled it with such vigor that a whole column of 7,000
dispersed and fled into the hills of Bohemia for safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>Napoleon now determined to pass the Spree in front of
the enemy, and they permitted him to do so, rather than
come down from their position. He took up his quarters
in the town of Bautzen, and his whole army bivouacked
in presence of the allies.</p>

<p>The battle was resumed at daybreak on the 22d; when
Ney on the right, and Oudinot on the left, attempted
simultaneously to turn the flanks of the position; while
Soult and Napoleon himself directed charge after charge
on the centre. During four hours the struggle was maintained
with unflinching obstinacy. The wooded heights,
where Blucher commanded, had been taken and retaken
several times, ere the allies perceived the necessity of
retiring or losing the engagement. They finally withdrew,
panic-stricken, continuing their retreat with such celerity as
to gain time to rally on the roads leading to Bohemia, all
others being closed against them. The want of cavalry,
however, again prevented Napoleon from turning his success
to account.</p>

<p>During the whole of the ensuing day Napoleon, at the
head of the cavalry of the Guard, urged pursuit and
exposed at all times his own person in the very hottest of
the fire. By his side was Duroc, grand master of the
palace&mdash;his dearest friend. "Duroc," said the Emperor,
on the morning of the battle, "fortune has a spite at us
to-day."</p>

<p>About 7 o'clock in the evening, Duroc was conversing
on a slight eminence, and at a considerable distance from
the firing, with Marshal Mortier and General Kirgener,&mdash;all
three on foot,&mdash;when a cannon-ball, aimed at the group,
ploughed up the ground near Mortier, ripped open Duroc's
abdomen and struck General Kirgener dead on the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>Napoleon hastened to Duroc as soon as he heard of the
event and was deeply moved on beholding him. The
latter, who was still conscious, said to the Emperor: "All
my life has been devoted to your service, and I only regret
its loss for the use which it might still have been to you."</p>

<p>"Duroc," replied the Emperor, "there is another life!
it is there that you will await me and there we shall one
day meet."&mdash;"Yes, Sire, but that will be in thirty years,
when you shall have triumphed over your enemies, and
realized the hopes of your country; I have lived an
honest man and have nothing to reproach myself with.
I leave a daughter, your Majesty will be a father to her."</p>

<p>At Duroc's own solicitation the Emperor retired to spare
him further grief. Napoleon had ordered his troops to
halt, and he remained all the afternoon in front of his
tent, surrounded by the Guard, who did not witness his
affliction without tears. He stood by Duroc while he died
and drew up with his own hand an epitaph, to be placed
over his remains by the pastor of the place, and who
received two hundred napoleons to defray the expense of a
fitting monument. Thus closed the 22d.</p>

<p>That night Napoleon, after dictating the bulletin of the
battle, wrote the following decree, "which," says Alison,
"all lovers of the arts, as well as admirers of patriotic
virtue, must regret was prevented by his fall from being
carried into execution:"&mdash;"A monument shall be erected
on Mount Cenis; on the most conspicuous space the
following inscription shall be written: 'The Emperor
Napoleon, from the field of Wurschen, has ordered the
erection of this monument in testimony of his gratitude
to the people of France and of Italy. This monument
will transmit, from age to age, the remembrance of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
great epoch, when, in the space of three months, twelve
hundred thousand men flew to arms, to protect the integrity
of the French Empire.'"</p>

<p>The allies, although strongly posted during the most of
the day, had lost 10,000 men. They continued to retreat
into Upper Silesia, and Napoleon advanced to Breslau and
released the garrison of Glogau. General Regnier obtained
fresh advantage over the Russians in the affair of Gorlitz
on the following day, and on the 24th Marshal Ney forced
the passage of the Neiss and in the morning of the 25th
was beyond the Quiess where he met the Emperor.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Austrians, having watched these
indecisive though bloody fields, and daily defeats of the
allies, sought to bring about an armistice, but only with a
view of gaining them time to recuperate. The sovereigns
of Russia and Prussia expressed a willingness to accept
it, and Napoleon also was desirous of bringing his disputes
to a peaceful termination until the 10th of August.
He agreed to an armistice, and in arranging its conditions,
agreed to fall back out of Silesia, thus enabling the allies
to reopen communications with Berlin. On the first of
June the lines of truce to be occupied by the armies was
signed, the French Emperor returned to Dresden, and a
general congress of diplomatists prepared to meet at
Prague, England alone refusing to send a representative
alleging that Napoleon had as yet signified no intention
to recede from his position with regard to Spain.</p>

<p>The armistice was arranged purely to gain time. Napoleon's
successes, while unproductive, were dazzling in
their execution, and the allies found it of the utmost
importance to stop hostilities until the advance of Bernadotte,
and secure further time for the arrival of new rein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>forcements
from Russia; for the completion of the Prussian
organization and, above all, for determining the
policy of Vienna.</p>

<p>While inferior diplomatists wasted much time in endless
discussions at Prague one interview between Prince Metternich
and Napoleon, at Dresden, brought the whole
question to a definite issue. The Emperor, during the
course of their conversation, is said to have asked "What
is your price? Will Illyria satisfy you? I only wish you
to be neutral&mdash;I can deal with these Russians and Prussians
single-handed."</p>

<p>Metternich answered that the time in which Austria
could be neutral was past; that the situation of Europe at
large must be considered. He declared that the Rhenish
Confederacy must be broken up, that France must be
contented with the boundary of the Rhine and pretend no
longer to maintain her unnatural influence in Germany.
Napoleon replied, "Come Metternich, tell me honestly
how much the English have given you to take their part
against me?"</p>

<p>At length the Austrian Court sent a formal document
containing its ultimatum, the tenor of which Metternich
had indicated in his conversation. Napoleon was urged
by his ministers, Talleyrand and Fouché, two arch-intriguers,
to accede to the proffered terms. Their arguments
were backed by intelligence of the most disastrous
character from Spain. Wellington, on perceiving that
Napoleon had greatly weakened his armies in that country,
while preparing for his campaign against Prussia and
Russia, had once more advanced and was now in possession
of the supreme authority over the Spanish armies
as well as the Portugese and English, and had appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
in greater force than ever. The French had suffered defeat
at several points and on the 21st of June, Joseph Bonaparte
and Marshal Jourdan had sustained a total defeat, and
the former was now retreating towards the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>Berthier concurred in pressing upon the Emperor the
desirability of making peace on the terms proposed, or to
draw in his garrisons on the Oder and Elbe, whereby he
would strengthen his army with 50,000 veterans and
retire to the Rhine. There, it was urged, with such a
force assembled on such a river, and with all the resources
of France behind him, he might bid defiance to the united
armies of Europe, and, at worst, obtain a peace that
would leave him in secure tenure of a nobler dominion
than any of the kings, his predecessors, had even hoped
to possess. "Ten lost battles," he replied, "would not
sink me lower than you would have me place myself by
my own voluntary act; but one battle gained enables me
to seize Berlin and Breslau and make peace on terms compatible
with my glory."</p>

<p>Finally, Metternich suddenly broke off all negotiations,
and on the 12th of August, Austria declared war against
France. It was an act of bold and shameless perfidy;
but Metternich was richly rewarded for his treachery by
the crowned heads of Europe. It was then that Napoleon
discovered the depth of the abyss on which he had
set his foot. He had lived in the hopes that his alliance
with the House of Austria, by marriage with Marie Louise,
would prevent the Archduchess' father from taking the
field against him, but in this he was sadly disappointed.
Austria now signed an alliance, offensive and defensive,
with Russia and Prussia. Thus was consolidated at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
the great coalition. The sovereigns of the nations of
Europe had leagued together and sworn to crush the
Emperor of France.</p>

<p>On the night between the 10th and 11th rockets answering
rockets, from height to height along the frontiers of
Bohemia and Silesia, had announced to all the armies of
the allies this accession of strength and the immediate
recommencement of hostilities. Napoleon had now been
several weeks with his army at Dresden and it had been
fondly hoped by the populace that on the birthday of the
French Emperor, a peace with Europe would be signed.
They had prepared a magnificent festival in his honor and
to celebrate the restoration of peace. Their hopes were
considerably lessened, however, by an order for the fête to
take place on the 10th in conjunction with a grand review
of the army. On the great plain of Ostra-Gehege, near
Dresden, the imperial troops were drawn up, and in the
presence of the King of Saxony, the Emperor's brothers,
marshals, and the chief dignitaries of the Empire, Napoleon
held his last review. Twenty thousand of the Old
Guard, five thousand of whom were mounted on fine
horses richly caparisoned, with the whole of his vast
army, defiled before their Imperial Commander. At night
a banquet was spread for his gallant veterans.</p>

<p>Military preparations had been progressing on both sides
during the cessation of hostilities. Napoleon now had a
force of 250,000 men distributed as follows: Macdonald
lay with 100,000 at Buntzlaw, on the border of Silesia;
another corps of 50,000 had their headquarters at Zittau,
in Lusatia; St. Cyr, with 20,000 was at Pirna on the
great pass from Bohemia; Oudinot at Leipsic, with 60,000;
while with the Emperor himself at Dresden remained
25,000 of the Imperial Guard, the flower of France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>Behind the Erzgebirge, or Metallic Mountains, and
having their headquarters at Prague, lay the grand army
of the allies, consisting of 120,000 Austrians and 80,000
Russians and Prussians; commanded in chief by the Austrian
general Schwartzenberg. The French corps at
Zittau and Pirna were prepared to encounter these, should
the attempt to force their way into Saxony, either on the
right or the left of the Elbe. The second army of the
allies, consisting of 80,000 Russians and Prussians,&mdash;called
the army of Silesia,&mdash;and commanded by Blucher, lay in
advance of Breslau. Lastly, the Crown Prince of Sweden,
Bernadotte, who had been influenced by a belief that he
was to succeed to the throne of France, was at Berlin, with
30,000 of his own troops, and 60,000 Russians and Prussians.
Oudinot and Macdonald were so stationed that he
could not approach the upper valley of the Elbe without
encountering one of them, and they also had the means of
mutual communication and support.</p>

<p>Napoleon had evidently arranged his troops with the
view of making isolated assaults, and beating them in
detail. He was opposed, however, by generals who were
well acquainted with his tactics but none of whom, except
Blucher, was above mediocre in generalship. The three
allied commanders had prepared counter schemes to frustrate
his arrangements, having agreed that whosoever of
them should be first assailed or pressed by the French,
they should on no account accept battle, but retreat; thus
tempting Napoleon in person to follow, leaving Dresden
open to the assault of some other great branch of their
confederacy, and to enable them at once to seize all his
magazines, to break the communications between the
remaining divisions of his army, and interpose a hostile force
in the rear of them all&mdash;between the Elbe and the Rhine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>This plan of campaign is believed to have been drawn
up by two of Napoleon's old marshals&mdash;Bernadotte and
Moreau&mdash;both traitors. The latter had just returned
from America on the invitation of the Emperor Alexander,
whither he had gone after being exiled, and had joined
the Allies in their warfare on the French Emperor.</p>

<p>The first movement was made by Blucher, and no sooner
did Napoleon become aware that he was threatening the
position of Macdonald than he quitted Dresden. He left
with his Guard and a powerful force of cavalry on the
15th of August, and proceeded to the support of his
marshal. The Prussian commander adhered faithfully to
the general plan and retired across the Katsbach, in the
face of his enemies. While in pursuit of him Napoleon
was informed that Schwartzenberg had rushed down from
the Bohemian hills and abandoning Blucher to the care of
Macdonald, sent his Guard back to Dresden leaving for
the same point himself on the 23d.</p>

<p>Schwartzenberg made his appearance on the heights
to the south of the Saxon capital on the 25th, having
driven St. Cyr and his 20,000 men before him.</p>

<p>The army of St. Cyr had thrown itself into the city of
Dresden and on the 26th were assailed in six columns,
each more numerous than its garrison. The French
marshal had about begun to despair when the Imperial
Guard made its appearance, crossing the bridge from
the eastern side of the Elbe, and in their midst was the
Emperor himself. His arrival was most timely and the two
sallies executed by those troops, hot and tired from their
long and tiresome march, caused the allies to be driven back
some distance. Night then set in and the two armies remained
very near together until the next morning when
the battle was renewed amidst a storm of wind and rain.</p>

<p>The Emperor, by movements most phenomenal, now
had 200,000 men gathered round him, and he poured
them out with such skill on either flank of the enemy's
line, that ere the close of the day they were forced to
withdraw. At 3 o'clock the battle of Dresden was
definitely gained for Napoleon. The allied monarchs, in
danger of losing their communication with Bohemia, were
obliged to provide for their safety and beat a retreat
leaving in the power of the Conqueror from twenty-five
to thirty thousand prisoners, forty flags, and sixty pieces
of cannon.</p>

<p>Napoleon remained on the field until his victory was
decided, and then returned to Dresden on horseback; his
gray-coat, and weather-worn hat streaming with water,
and his whole appearance forming a singular contrast to
that of Murat, who rode by his side with all the splendor
of his usual battle-dress. The latter had, however,
especially distinguished himself during the action.</p>

<p>On either side 8,000 men had been slain or wounded
and one of the ablest of all the enemy's generals&mdash;Moreau,
had fallen. Early in the day Napoleon had observed a
group of reconnoitring officers and ordered that ten
cannon be prepared at once. He believed that he recognized
in the group "the traitor Moreau." He at once
ordered that the heavy guns, charged with all their power,
be pointed in that direction. He superintended the operation
and decided himself the angle of elevation, the aim
and the moment to fire. Ten pieces went off at once,
carrying a storm of cannon-shot over the heads of the
contending armies. This was followed by a movement
which was thought to indicate that some person of importance
had been wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>A peasant came in the evening and brought with him
a bloody boot and a grey-hound, both the property, he
said, of a great man who was no more; the words on the
dog's collar were: "I belong to General Moreau." Moreau
was dead. Both his legs had been shot off. It is said he
continued to smoke a cigar while the surgeon dressed his
wounds, in the presence of Alexander, and died shortly
after.</p>

<p>The fatigues Napoleon had undergone between the 15th
and 28th of August now overcame him and he was unable
to remain with the columns in the rear of Schwartzenberg,
but returned to Dresden. Here he learned of Vandamme's
failure in an engagement in the valley of Culm with a
Prussian corps commanded by Count D'Osterman,
wherein the French lieutenant laid down his arms with
8,000 prisoners. This news reached Napoleon, still sick,
at Dresden. "Such," he said to Murat, "is the fortune
of war&mdash;high in the morning, low ere night; between
triumph and ruin there intervenes but one step."</p>

<p>No sooner did Blucher perceive that Napoleon had
retired from Silesia than he resumed the offensive, still
carrying out Moreau's advice, "attack Napoleon where he
is not!" and descended from the position he had taken at
Jauer. He encountered Macdonald,&mdash;who was by no means
prepared for him,&mdash;on the plains between Wahlstadt and
the river Katsbach, on the 26th of August, and after a
hard fought day, gained a complete victory. The French
lost 15,000 men and 100 guns and fell back on Dresden.
Oudinot was defeated on the 23d of August by Bernadotte
at Gross-Beeren and Ney suffered like reverses on
the 7th of September at Dennewitz, leaving 10,000 prisoners
and forty-six guns in the hands of Bernadotte.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>Napoleon now recovered his health and activity, and
the exertions he made at this time were never surpassed,
even by himself. On the 3d of September he was in
quest of Blucher who had now advanced near to the Elbe,
but the Prussians retired and baffled him as before.
Returning to Dresden he received the news of Dennewitz
and immediately afterwards heard that Witgenstein had a
second time descended towards Pirna. He flew thither
on the instant, the Russian gave way, according to the
plan of campaign, and Napoleon returned once more to
Dresden. Again he was told that Blucher on the one
side, and Witgenstein on the other, were availing themselves
of his absence, and advancing. He once more
returned to Pirna; a third time the Russian retired.
Napoleon followed him as far as Peterswald and once
more returned to his centre point.</p>

<p>Bernadotte and Blucher finally effected a junction to
the west of the Elbe, despite the heroic exertions of Ney
who, on witnessing the combination of these armies
retreated to Leipsic. Napoleon now ordered Regnier and
Bertrand to march suddenly from Dresden to Berlin in
the hope of recalling Blucher, but without success.
Meantime Schwartzenberg was found to be skirting
round the hills to the westward, as if for the purpose of
joining Blucher and Bernadotte, in the neighborhood of
Leipsic.</p>

<p>It became manifest that Leipsic was now becoming
the common centre towards which the forces of
France and all her enemies were converging. Napoleon
reached that venerable city on the 15th of October and
almost immediately the heads of Schwartzenberg's columns
began to appear towards the south. Napoleon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
having made all his preparations, reconnoitred every
outpost in person, and distributed eagles to some new
regiments which had just joined him. The young soldiers,
with a splendid ceremony, swore to die rather than
witness the dishonor of France. Five hundred thousand
men were now in presence of each other under the walls or
in the environs of Leipsic and a grand battle had become
inevitable.</p>

<p>At midnight three rockets, emitting a brilliant white
light, sprang into the heavens to the south of the city.
These marked the position on which Schwartzenberg&mdash;having
with him the Emperor of Austria, as well as
Alexander and Frederick William, had fixed his headquarters.
They were answered by four rockets of a deep
red color ascending from the northern horizon.</p>

<p>Napoleon now became convinced that he was to sustain,
on the morrow, the assault of Blucher and Bernadotte as
well as the grand army of the allies. Blucher was indeed
ready to co-operate with Schwartzenberg, and though the
Crown Prince had not yet reached his ground, the numerical
strength of the enemy was very great. Napoleon had
with him to defend the line of villages to the north and
south of Leipsic, 134,000 infantry and 22,000 cavalry;
while, even in the absence of Bernadotte, who might be
hourly looked for, the allies mustered not less than 340,000
combatants, including 54,000 cavalry.</p>

<p>At daybreak on the 16th of October, the battle began
on the southern side, the allies charging the French line
there six times in succession, and were as often repelled.
But it was not sufficient for the Emperor to resist with
success and to hold his positions; he had, more than ever,
need of a signal triumph, of a decisive victory; and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
his enemies failed in their first attack, it was for him to
attack them briskly in turn without giving them time to
stay the disorder and discouragement of their columns,
and to replace by fresh troops the fatigued and beaten
soldiers; and this Napoleon did. He at once charged and
with such effect, that Murat's cavalry were at one
time in possession of a great gap between the two wings
of the enemy. The Cossacks of the Russian Imperial
Guard, however, encountered the French horse, and
pushed them back again, preserving the army of the allies
from a total defeat. The combat raged without intermission
until nightfall, when both armies bivouacked exactly
where the morning light had found them. "The allies were
so numerous" said Napoleon at St. Helena, "that when
their troops were fatigued they were regularly relieved
as on dress parade!" With such a numerical superiority,
they could scarcely be definitely beaten; therefore, notwithstanding
the prodigies of valor performed by the
French army, the victory remained almost undecided. In
the centre and to the right the French had maintained
their position but on the left treachery made them lose
ground.</p>

<p>Marmont commanded on this side. Blucher attacked
him with a vastly superior force in numbers and while
nothing could be more obstinate than his defense, he lost
many prisoners and guns, was driven from his original
ground, and occupied when the day closed, a new position,
much nearer the walls of the city.</p>

<p>Napoleon became convinced that he must at last retreat
from Leipsic and he now made an effort to obtain peace.
General Merfeld, the same Austrian officer who had come
to his headquarters after the battle of Austerlitz, to pray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
for an armistice on the part of the Emperor Francis, had
been made prisoner in the course of the day, and Napoleon
resolved to employ him as his messenger. Merfeld
informed him that the King of Bavaria had at length
acceded to the alliance, thus adding greatly to his perplexities
in finding a new enemy stationed on the line of
his march to France.</p>

<p>The Emperor asked the Austrian to request for him the
personal intervention of Francis. "I will renounce
Poland and Illyria" said he, "Holland, the Hanse Towns,
and Spain. I will consent to lose the sovereignty of the
kingdom of Italy, provided that state remain as an independent
one, and I will evacuate all Germany. Adieu!
Count Merfeld. When on my part you name the word
armistice to the two emperors, I doubt not the sound will
awaken many recollections."</p>

<p>Napoleon received no answer to his message. The
allied princes had sworn to each other to entertain no
treaty while one French soldier remained on the eastern
side of the Rhine. He therefore prepared for the difficult
task of retreating with 100,000 men, through a crowded
town, in presence of an enemy already twice as numerous,
and in hourly expectation of being joined by a third great
and victorious army. During the 17th the battle was not
renewed except by a distant and partial cannonade. The
allies were determined to have the support of Bernadotte
in the decisive contest.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th the battle began again
about 8 o'clock and continued until nightfall without
intermission. Never was Napoleon's generalship or the
gallantry of his troops more thoroughly tested than on this
terrible day. He again commanded on the south and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
again, in spite of the vast superiority of the enemy's
numbers, the French maintained their ground to the end.
On the north the arrival of Bernadotte enabled Blucher to
push his advantages with irresistible effect; and the situation
of Marmont and Ney was further perplexed by the
shameful defection of 12,000 Saxons who went over with all
their artillery to the enemy in the very midst of the battle.
These Saxons, forming nearly a third of the left, ran over
to the Russians, entered their ranks, and at Bernadotte's
request discharged their artillery on the French, their fellow-soldiers,
whom they had just abandoned!</p>

<p>The loss on either side had been very great. Napoleon's
army consisted chiefly of very young men, many were
merely boys, yet they fought as bravely as the Guard.
The failure of the Emperor was partly occasioned by a want
of ammunition; as in the course of five days, having fired
more than two hundred and fifty thousand shots, his troops
had not sufficient to continue the firing two hours longer.
As the nearest reserves were at Magdeburg and Erfurt,
Napoleon determined to march for the latter place. He
gave orders at midnight for the commencement of the
inevitable retreat, and while the darkness lasted, the troops
continued to file through the town, and across the two
bridges, over the Pleisse, beyond its walls. One of these
bridges was a temporary fabric and broke down ere daylight
came to show the enemy the movement of the
retreating French.</p>

<p>The confusion necessarily accompanying the march of
a whole army, through narrow streets, and upon a single
bridge, was fearful. The allies stormed at the gates on
either side, and, but for the heroism of Macdonald and
Poniatowski, to whom Napoleon intrusted the defense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
the suburbs, it is doubted whether he himself could have
escaped in safety. At 9 in the morning of the 19th Napoleon
bade farewell to the King of Saxony who had
remained all the while in the heart of his ancient city.
The King was left to make whatever terms he could
with the Allied Sovereigns.</p>

<p>The battle was now raging all round the walls and at
11 o'clock the allies had gathered close to the bridge.
The officer to whom Napoleon had committed the task of
blowing up the structure, when the advance of the enemy
should render this necessary, set fire to the train much
too soon. The crowd of men, urging each other on to a
point of safety could not at once be stopped and soldiers,
horses and cannon, rolled headlong into the deep, but
narrow river. Marshal Macdonald swam the stream in
safety, but the gallant Poniatowski, who defended the
suburbs inch by inch, and had been twice wounded ere he
plunged his horse into the current, sank to rise no more.
This order was given to Poniatowski by the Emperor
himself: "Prince" said Napoleon to him, "you will
defend the southern faubourg." "Sire" he replied, "I
have but few people." "Ah! well! you will defend
yourself with what you have." "Ah! Sire, we will
maintain it! We are always ready to perish for your
Majesty." The illustrious, unfortunate Pole kept his
word; he was never again to behold the Emperor. Later
Napoleon said of him: "Poniatowski was a noble man,
honorable and brave. Had I succeeded in Russia, I
intended to make him king of Poland."</p>

<p>The body of the Prince was found on the fifth day by a
fisherman. He had on his gala uniform, the epaulets of
which were studded with diamonds, and upon his fingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
were several rings covered with brilliants, while his
pockets contained snuff-boxes of considerable value, and
other trinkets. Many of these were eagerly purchased
by Polish officers who had been made prisoners.
Twenty-five thousand Frenchmen, the means of escape
being entirely cut off, now laid down their arms within
the city with more than two hundred pieces of cannon.
In killed, wounded and prisoners, Napoleon lost at Leipsic
at least 50,000 men.</p>

<p>"This defeat at Leipsic" says St. Amand, "was for Napoleon
a combination of grief and surprise. Of all the
battles he had fought, this was the first that he had lost.
Up to that time he could boast that if he had been conquered
by the elements he had never been conquered by
man; and now he was to know for himself the sufferings he
had inflicted on others. He was to learn by personal
experience the bitterness of defeat, the anguish of retreat,
the desperation of useless bloodshed. War, which up to
this time had been a source of gratification to his unparalleled
pride, now showed to him its horrors, with its
humiliations and inexpressible anguish. The hour had
struck when he could make tardy reflections on the
emptiness of genius and glory on the intoxication of pride
that had turned his head."</p>

<p>The retreat of the French through Saxony was a sad
ending to the auspicious beginning which the Emperor
had opened the campaign with. Napoleon conducted
himself as became a great mind amidst great misfortunes;
he appeared at all times calm and self-possessed, receiving
every day that he advanced new tidings of evil, for the
peasantry was hostile, supplies scarce, and added to this
was the persevering pursuit of the Cossacks who attacked
at every opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>The Emperor halted for two days at Erfurt, where
extensive magazines had been established, employing all
his energies in the restoring of discipline. He resumed
his march on the 25th of October, 1813, towards the
Rhine. The Austro-Bavarians hastened to meet him and
had taken up a position amidst the woods near Hanau
before the Emperor reached the Mayne. He came up
with them on the morning of the 30th, and his troops
charged on the instant with the fury of desperation.
Napoleon cut his way through ere nightfall, and Marmont,
with the rear, had equal success on the 31st. In
these actions the French lost 6,000 men but the enemy
had 10,000 killed or wounded, and lost 4,000 prisoners.</p>

<p>The mill on the river Kinzig which runs without the
town, was the scene of many desperate struggles. Here
the French drove the Bavarians to the banks, precipitating
hundreds into the deep stream. The miller, however,
at the risk of his life, at length coolly went out, amidst a
shower of balls and stopped the flood-gates, so as to leave
a safe retreat to the Bavarians over the mill-dam. The
side of the town next to the scene of battle was constantly
taken and retaken by the contending armies, and during
the night of the 30th the watch-word was changed not
less than seven times. Six of the Austro-Bavarian's generals
were killed or wounded and both cannon and flags
were left in the power of the conqueror.</p>

<p>The pursuit of Napoleon, which had been intrusted to
the Austrians, was far from vigorous and no considerable
annoyance succeeded the battle of Hanau. The relics of
the French host, now reduced to 60,000 men, at length
passed the Rhine; and the Emperor, having quitted them
at Mayence, arrived in Paris on the 9th of November.</p>

THE INVASION OF FRANCE</h2>

<p class="p2">By the defeat of the Emperor in the campaign of 1813
the Confederation of the Rhine was dissolved forever.
The princes who adhered to that league were now permitted
to sue for forgiveness by bringing a year's revenue
and a double conscription to the banner of the Allies.
Bernadotte turned from Leipsic to reduce the garrisons
which Napoleon had not seen fit to call in, and one
by one they fell, though in most cases, particularly at
Dantzic, Wirtemberg and Hamburg, the resistance was
obstinate and long.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince of Sweden having witnessed the
reduction of some of these fortresses, and intrusted the
siege of others to his lieutenants, invaded Denmark and
the government of that country severed its long adhesion
to Napoleon by a treaty concluded at Kiel on the 14th of
January, 1814. Sweden yielded Pomerania to Denmark;
Denmark gave up Norway to Sweden; and 10,000 Danish
troops having joined his standard, Bernadotte turned his
face towards the Netherlands. Holland also revolted
after Leipsic, the Prince of Orange returning in triumph
from England and assumed administration of affairs in
the November following. On the side of Italy, Eugene
Beauharnais was driven beyond the Adige by an Austrian
army headed by General Hiller, and it was not at all
likely that he could hope to maintain Lombardy much
longer. To complete Napoleon's perplexity his brother-in-law,
Murat, was negotiating with Austria and willing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
provided Naples was guaranteed to him, to array the force
of that state on the side of the Confederacy. Beyond the
Pyrenees, Soult, who had been sent from Dresden to
retrieve, if possible, the fortunes of the army defeated in
June at Vittoria, had been twice defeated; the fortresses
had fallen, and except a detached, and now useless force
under Suchet in Catalonia, there remained no longer a
single French soldier in Spain.</p>

<p>Such were the tidings which reached Napoleon from
his Italian and Spanish frontiers at the very moment
when it was necessary for him to make head against the
Russians, the Austrians, and the Germans, chiefly armed
and supplied at the expense of England, and now rapidly
concentrating in three great masses on different points of
the valley of the Rhine. The royalists, too, were exerting
themselves indefatigably in the capital and the provinces,
having recovered a large share of their ancient influence
in the society of Paris even before the Russian expedition.
The Bourbon princes watched the course of events
with eager hope. The republicans, meanwhile, were not
inactive. They had long since been alienated from Napoleon
by his assumption of the imperial dignity, his creation
of orders and nobles, and his alliance with the House
of Austria; these men had observed, with hardly less
delight than the royalists, that succession of reverses
which had followed Napoleon in his last two campaigns.
Finally, not a few of Napoleon's own ministers and generals
were well prepared to take a part in his overthrow.
Talleyrand, and others only second to him in influence,
were in communication with the Bourbons, before the
allies crossed the Rhine. "Ere then," said Napoleon, "I
felt the reins slipping from my hands."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>The Allied Princes issued at Frankfort, a manifesto on
the 1st of December in which the sovereigns announced
their belief that it was for the interests of Europe that
France should continue to be a powerful state, and their
willingness to concede to her, even now, greater extent
of territory than the Bourbon kings had ever claimed&mdash;the
boundaries, namely, of the Rhine, the Alps, and the
Pyrenees. Their object in invading France was to put an
end to the authority which Napoleon had usurped over
other nations. The hostility of Europe, they said, was
against,&mdash;not France, but Napoleon&mdash;and even as to
Napoleon, against not his person but his system. These
terms were tendered to the Emperor himself, and although
he authorized Caulaincourt to commence negotiations in
his behalf, it was merely for the purpose of gaining time.</p>

<p>Napoleon's military operations were now urged with
unremitting energy. New conscriptions were called for,
and granted; every arsenal sounded with the fabrication
of arms. The press was thoroughly aroused and with its
mighty voice warned the allies against an invasion of the
sacred soil of France. The French Senate was somewhat
reluctant, however; they ventured to hint to the Emperor
that ancient France would remain to him, even if he
accepted the proposals of the allies. "Shame on you,"
cried the Emperor, "Wellington has entered the south,
the Russians menace the northern frontier, the Prussians,
Austrians, and Bavarians the eastern. Shame! Wellington
is in France and we have not risen <i>en masse</i> to
drive him back! All my allies have deserted&mdash;the
Bavarian has betrayed me. No peace until we have
burned Munich! I demand a levy of 300,000 men&mdash;with
this and what I already have, I shall see a million in arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
I will form a camp of 100,000 at Bordeaux; another at
Mentz; a third at Lyons. But I must have grown men:
these boys only serve to incumber the hospitals and the
road-sides. Abandon Holland! Sooner yield it back to
the sea! Senators, an impulse must be given&mdash;all must
march&mdash;you are fathers of families&mdash;the head of the
nation&mdash;you must set the example. Peace! I hear of
nothing but peace when all around should echo to the cry
of war!"</p>

<p>The Senate drew up and presented a report which
renewed the Emperor's wrath. He reproached them openly
with designing to purchase inglorious ease for themselves,
at the expense of his honor. "In your address" he said,
"you seek to separate the sovereign from the nation. I
alone am the representative of the people. And which of
you could charge himself with a like burden? The throne
is but of wood, decked with velvet. If I believed you, I
should yield the enemy more than he demands; in three
months you shall have peace, or I will perish. It is
against me that our enemies are more embittered than
against France, but on that ground alone am I to be suffered
to dismember the State? Do not sacrifice my pride and
my dignity to obtain peace. Yes, I am proud because
I am courageous; I am proud because I have done great
things for France. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* You wished to bespatter me
with mud, but I am one of those men who may be killed
yet not dishonored.</p>

<p>"Return to your homes *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* even supposing me
to have been in the wrong, there was no occasion to
reproach me publicly; dirty linen should be washed at
home. For the rest; <i>France has more need of me, than I
have of France</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>Having uttered these words the Emperor repaired to his
council of state and there denounced the Legislative Senate
as one composed of one part of traitors and eleven of
dupes. "In place of assisting," he said, "they impede
me. Our attitude alone could have repelled the enemy&mdash;they
invite him. We should have presented a front of
brass&mdash;they lay open wounds to his view. I will not suffer
their report to be printed. They have not done their
duty, but I will do mine&mdash;I dissolve the Legislative
Senate!"</p>

<p>The Pope was now released from his confinement and
returned to Rome which he found in the hands of Murat,
who had ere then concluded his treaty with Francis and
was advancing into the north of Italy, with the view of
co-operating in the campaign against Beauharnais, with
the Austrians on one side and on the other with an English
force recently landed at Leghorn, under Lord William
Bentinck. Ferdinand also returned to Spain, after five
years of captivity, amid universal acclamations. "When
first informed of Murat's treason, by the Viceroy
(Eugene)," says Bourrienne "the Emperor refused to believe
it. 'No!' he exclaimed to those about him, 'It cannot
be! Murat&mdash;to whom I have given my sister! Eugene must
be misinformed. It is impossible that Murat has declared
himself against me.' It was, however, not only possible
but true." As St. Amand well says, in speaking of
Murat's desertion: "He might have united his forces
with those of Prince Eugene and have attacked the invasion
in the rear; he would have saved the Empire of
France; he would have died on the throne, covered with
glory, instead of being shot!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>For a time the inhabitants of the French provinces
on the frontier believed it impossible that any foreign
army would dare to invade their soil, and it was not until
Schwartzenberg had crossed the Rhine between Basle and
Schaffhausen on the 20th of December, that they were
willing to believe in the sincerity of the Allies and their
determination to carry the war into France itself. Disregarding
the claim of the Swiss to preserve neutrality,
Schwartzenberg advanced through that territory with his
grand army, unopposed&mdash;an indefensible act in itself, and
began to show himself in Franche-Compté, in Burgundy,
even to the gates of Dijon.</p>

<p>On the 1st of January, 1814, the Silesian army, under
Blucher, crossed the river at various points between
Rastadt, and Coblentz; and shortly after, the army of the
north, commanded by Witzingerode and Bulow, began to
penetrate the frontier of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The Pyrenees had been crossed by Wellington and the
Rhine by three mighty hosts, amounting altogether to
300,000 men and including every tongue and tribe from
the Germans of Westphalia to the wildest barbarians of
Tartary. "Seven hundred thousand men," says Dumas,
"trained by their very defeats in the great school of
Napoleonic war, were advancing into the heart of
France, passing by all fortified places and responding, the
one to the other, by the single cry, 'Paris! Paris!'"</p>

<p>The allies proclaimed everywhere as they advanced,
that they came as the friends, not the enemies of the
French nation, and that any of the peasantry who took up
arms to oppose them must be content to abide the treatment
of brigands; a flagrant outrage against the most
sacred and inalienable rights of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, nearer and nearer each day the torrent of
invasion rolled on, sweeping before it, with but slight
resistance, the various corps which had been left to watch
the Rhine. Ney, Marmont, Victor and Mortier, commanding
in all about 50,000 men, retired of necessity before
the enemy.</p>

</div>

<p>It now became apparent that the allies had resolved to
carry the war into the interior without waiting for the
reduction of the great fortresses on the Rhenish frontier.
They passed on with hosts overwhelmingly superior to all
those of Napoleon's lieutenants, who withdrew, followed
by crowds of the rustic population, rushing onwards
towards Paris by any means of transport. Carts and
wagons, filled with terrified women and children thronged
every avenue to the capital.</p>

<p>The Emperor now resolved to break silence to the
Parisians and prepared to reappear in the field. On the
22d of January, 1814, the official news of the invasion
appeared. The next morning&mdash;Sunday&mdash;the officers of
the National Guard to the number of nine hundred were
summoned to the Tuileries. Napoleon took his station in
the centre of the hall and immediately the Empress, with
her son, the King of Rome, carried in the arms of Countess
Montesquiou, appeared at his side.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the Emperor "France is invaded;
I go to put myself at the head of my troops, and with God's
help and their valor, I hope soon to drive the enemy
beyond the frontier." Here he took Marie Louise in one
hand and her son in the other, and continued, "But if
they should approach the capital, I confide to the National
Guard the Empress and the King of Rome&mdash;my wife and
my child!"&mdash;Several officers stepped from their places
and approached with tears in their eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>The Emperor spent part of the 24th of January in
reviewing troops in the court-yard of the Tuileries, while
the snow was falling, and at 3 o'clock in the morning of
the 25th once more left his capital, after having burnt his
most secret papers, and embraced his wife and son for the
last time, to begin his fifteenth campaign. Thiers says
of this farewell: "Napoleon, when he left, unconscious
that he was embracing them for the last time, hugged
tenderly his wife and son. His wife was in tears, and she
feared she would never see him again. She was in fact
fated never to see him, although the enemy's bullets were
not to kill him. She would certainly have been much
surprised if she had been told that this husband, then the
object of all her care, was to die on a distant island, the
prisoner of Europe, and forgotten by her. As for him,
no prediction would have astonished him,&mdash;whether the
cruelest desertion, the most ardent devotion,&mdash;for he
expected anything from men; he knew them to the core,
though he treated them as if he did not know what they
really were."</p>

<p>The Emperor again appointed Marie Louise Empress-Regent,
placed his brother Joseph at the head of her
council, gave orders for raising military defenses around
Paris, and for converting many public buildings into
hospitals. He arrived at Chalons ere midnight and found
that Schwartzenberg with 97,000 men, and Blucher with
40,000 men, were now occupying an almost complete
line between the Marne and the Seine. Blucher was in
his own neighborhood and he immediately resolved to
attack the right of the Silesian army,&mdash;which was pushing
down the valley of the Marne, while its centre kept the
parallel course of the Aube,&mdash;ere the Prussian marshal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
could concentrate all his own strength or be supported by
Schwartzenberg who was advancing down the Seine
towards Bar.</p>

<p>On the 27th of January a sharp skirmish took place at
St. Dizier; and Blucher, who had committed all sorts of
excesses during the last two days, warned of Napoleon's
arrival, at once called in his detachments and took a post
of defense at Brienne&mdash;the same town where Bonaparte
had received his military education.</p>

<p>The Emperor marched through a thick forest upon the
scene of his youthful studies and appeared there on the
29th, having moved so rapidly that Blucher was at dinner
in the chateau when the French thundered at his gates,
and with difficulty escaped to the rear through a passage,
on foot and at the head of his staff.</p>

<p>The invaders maintained their place in the town courageously,
and some Cossacks, throwing themselves upon
the rear of the French, the Emperor was involved in the
mêlée; he quickly drew his sword and fought like a private
dragoon and General Gourgaud shot a Cossack while in
the act of thrusting a spear at Napoleon's back. The
town of Brienne was burned to the ground by the Prussians
in order to cover their retreat.</p>

<p>Alsusieff, the Russian commander, and Hardenberg, a
nephew of the Chancellor of Prussia, were made prisoners
and there was considerable slaughter on both sides.
Blucher retired further up the Aube with a loss of 4,000
men and posted himself at La Rothiere, where Schwartzenberg,
warned by the cannonade, hastened to co-operate
with him.</p>

<p>While at St. Helena Napoleon said that during the
charge of the Cossacks at Brienne defending himself, sword<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
in hand, he recognized a particular tree under which,
when a boy, he used to sit and read the "Jerusalem
Delivered" of Tasso. The field had been in those days,
part of the exercise-ground of the students, and the
chateau, whence Blucher escaped so narrowly, their
lodging.</p>

<p>Blucher now assumed the offensive, having joined
Schwartzenberg, and on the 1st of February assaulted the
rear-guard of the French army. Proud of their numerical
superiority they reckoned upon an easy triumph. The
battle lasted all day. At nightfall the French were
left in possession of their original positions. A battery
of guns had been taken, however, and Napoleon lost on
this occasion seventy-three guns, and some hundred
prisoners, besides a number of killed and wounded. The
result of this action was equivalent to a defeat of the French
army. The cannoniers saved themselves, with their baggage,
by forming a squadron and fighting vigorously as
soon as they perceived that there was no time to use their
pieces.</p>

<p>The battle of Brienne and the defense of La Rothiere,
Dienville and La Giberie, had gloriously opened the campaign,
but Blucher and Schwartzenberg had such considerable
forces at their disposal that Napoleon might fear
being surrounded, or cut off from his capital, if he persisted
in retaining his position in the environs of Brienne.
The allies had now definitely resolved to march on Paris.</p>

<p>While the division of Marmont retired down the Aube
before Blucher, Napoleon himself struck across the country
to Troyes which he had reasons to fear must be immediately
occupied by Schwartzenberg. Here he was joined
by a considerable body of his Guard, in high order and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
spirits, whose appearance restored, in a great measure,
the confidence of the troops who had been engaged in the
defense of La Rothiere. On the 3rd of February the
Emperor received a dispatch from Caulaincourt, informing
him that Lord Castlereagh, the English Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs, had arrived at the headquarters
of the allies, that negotiations were to be resumed the
morning after at Chatillon, and requesting him to intimate
distinctly at what price he would be willing to purchase
peace.</p>

<p>Napoleon replied by granting Caulaincourt full powers
to do everything necessary "to keep the negotiations
alive and save the capital." The Duke was unwilling to
act upon so broad a basis and sent back once more for a
specific detail of the Emperor's purposes.</p>

<p>Napoleon had his headquarters at Nogent, on the Seine,
some leagues below Troyes, when the dispatch reached
him on the evening of the 8th of February, and his counsellors
urged him to make use of this, probably last, opportunity.
He was prevailed upon to agree to abandon
Belgium, the left of the Rhine, Italy and Piedmont, but
in the night after the consultation, and before the ultimatum
had his signature, he received information which
caused him to change all his views. When Maret visited
him with his dispatches ready for signing Napoleon was
poring over his maps, tracing the route of Blucher on
Paris. "Oh here you are!" he exclaimed as Maret
entered, "but I am now thinking of something very
different&mdash;I am beating Blucher on the map. He is
advancing by the road to Montmirail; I will set out and
beat him to-morrow. Should this movement prove as
successful as I expect it will, the state of affairs will be
entirely changed, and we shall then see what can be done."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>The Emperor had learned that Blucher, instead of continuing
his march down the Aube, and in communication
with Schwartzenberg on the Seine, had transferred his
whole army to the Marne, and was now advancing towards
Paris by the Montmirail road.</p>

<p>The separation of their forces by the allies was a great
blunder and the Emperor, who at once detected it, could not
resist the temptation which it presented to make one warlike
effort more. Napoleon, therefore, refused to sign
the dispatch on the morning of the 9th and having left
small forces to defend the bridge over the Seine at Nogent
and at Bray, commenced his march, with the main body
of his army, upon Sezanne, prepared for one of the most
extraordinary and successful manoeuvres which has ever
been recorded in the annals of war.</p>

<p>Forty miles were traversed over a most difficult country,
usually considered impassable in winter,&mdash;ere the troops
halted with the dark. Next morning the army moved
again with equal alacrity, and at length debouched on the
road by which Blucher's army was advancing, at Champaubert.</p>

<p>The central division was passing when Napoleon suddenly
appeared at this point, and was altogether unable
to resist his assault. They dispersed in confusion with
great loss and fled towards the Marne. The General-in-chief,
Ousouwieff, at the head of twelve regiments
was completely routed. He was taken with 6,000 of his
men, and the remainder were drowned in a swamp, or
killed on the field of battle. Forty pieces of cannon, and all
the ammunition and baggage were left in the power of the
victor. Napoleon had now interposed his army between
the advanced guard of the Silesian army, commanded by
Sacken, and the rear commanded by Blucher himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>The van of the same army turned, on hearing the cannonade
of Champaubert, and countermarched with the
view of supporting Alsusieff only to share the fate of the
centre, and were put to flight after the loss of one-fourth of
the division.</p>

<p>Now it was Blucher's turn to be beaten. Napoleon
mounted his horse at midnight on the 13th and came up
with him at Montmirail. At 8 o'clock in the morning the
shouting of the soldiers announced the presence of the
Emperor. Blucher would gladly have declined battle,
but it was out of his power. He was conquered but
retreated with great skill and courage. After many
hours of hard fighting his retreat became a flight.
Blucher was frequently obliged to defend himself with
his sabre during the day, surrounded by his staff, and chiefly
owed his escape to the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>He retired in alternate squares, sustaining all day the
charges of the French with much loss of life and at
length cut his way, at Etoges, through a column of heavy
horse, sent round to intercept him, and drawn up on the
causeway.</p>

<p>On the following day there was a fresh success. A
hostile column, endeavoring to protect Blucher's retreat,
was taken at Chateau Thierry, where the French troops
entered pell-mell upon the Russians and Prussians. Five
generals of these two nations were among the prisoners.</p>

<p>Blucher finally crossed the Marne at Chalons. In five
days Napoleon's armies had been successful three times;
he had shattered and dispersed the Silesian army, and
above all, recovered the spirits of his own soldiery.</p>

<p>A column of 7,000 Prussian prisoners, with a considerable
number of guns and standards, reminded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
Parisians that the commander of the French troops had
not forgotten the art of warfare and their hopes were considerably
heightened on hearing of these successes against
the allies. But these allied armies, annihilated each
day, reappeared incessantly, and always ready for battle.
All Europe was now contending against the Emperor and her
beaten and dispersed soldiers were immediately replaced
by fresh troops. "So alarmed were the Allies at the near
approach of their terrible enemy," says Scott, "that a
message was sent to Napoleon, from the Allied Sovereigns,
by Prince Schwartzenberg's aide-de-camp, Count Par, stating
their surprise at his offensive movements, since they had
given orders to their plenipotentiaries at Chatillon to sign
the preliminaries of peace, on the terms which had been
assented to by the French envoy." Napoleon had, however,
learned the meaning of such messages in the course
of his career, and paid no attention to this one.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Parisians seen the prisoners from
Montmirail marched along their boulevards, before they
heard that the Cossacks were in possession of Fontainebleau.
Napoleon had left small divisions of his army to
guard the Seine at Nogent and Bray, and the enemy soon
discovered that the Emperor and his chief force were no
longer in that quarter. While he was beating Alsusieff,
Sacken and Blucher had made good the passage of the
Seine at three different points, driving the discomfited
guardians of these important places before them. Schwartzenberg
now had his quarters at Nangis, and was,
obviously, resolved to reach Paris, if possible, while
Napoleon was on the Marne. The light troops of the
grand allied army were scattering confusion on both sides
of the Seine, and one party of them was so near the
capital as Fontainebleau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>Napoleon now committed to Marmont and Mortier the
care of watching the Chalons road and the remains of
Blucher's army, and marched with his main body on
Meaux where on the 15th of February he received reinforcements
of 20,000 veterans from Spain, commanded by
Grouchy.</p>

<p>The latter's troops had aided Marmont on the 14th in a
victory over Blucher at the village of Vauchamp which
cost the allies ten thousand prisoners, ten flags, ten pieces
of cannon and many prisoners, including General Ouroussoff,
in command of the Russian rear-guard.</p>

<p>On the 16th Victor and Oudinot were engaged with the
van of Schwartzenberg, on the plains of Guignes, when
the Emperor came rapidly to their assistance. The
enemy immediately drew back, and concentrated his
strength at Nangis. Napoleon attacked that position on
the morning of the 17th, and with such effect that the
allies were completely routed and retreated after considerable
loss. They halted, however, at Montereau and Victor,
who commanded the pursuers on that route, failed to dislodge
them because of greatly inferior numbers. Napoleon
came up on the morning of the 18th and rebuked Victor;
then dismissed him from the service. The marshal,
with tears streaming down his face, said: "I will procure
a musket, I have not forgotten my old trade; Victor will
place himself in the ranks of the Guard."</p>

<p>The Emperor was vanquished by this noble language.
"Well! Well! Victor," said he, tendering his hand,
"remain; I cannot restore you your corps, since I have
given it to Gerard, but I award you two divisions of the
Guard; go and take the command of them, and let
there be no longer a question of anything between us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>The attack then commenced with fury and the bridge
and town of Montereau were carried. The defense was
long and stern, however, and Napoleon was occasionally
seen pointing cannon with his own hand, under the
heaviest of the fire. The artillerymen protested at the
exposure of his person and entreated him to withdraw.
He persisted in his work, answering gaily, "My children!
the bullet that shall kill me is not yet cast." The inhabitants
of Montereau associated themselves with this
triumph by firing from their windows on the Austrians
as they passed through the town.</p>

<p>After distributing praises and rewards to the generals
who had contributed to gaining this battle, Napoleon
thought of those who had delayed their march, or exhibited
negligence in their command, and among those
reprimanded were Generals Guyot, Digeon and Montbrun,
the latter for having abandoned the forest of Fontainebleau
to the Cossacks, without resistance.</p>

<p>Pursuing his advantage Napoleon saw the grand army
of the invaders continue their retreat in the direction of
Troyes, and on the morning of the 22d arrived before
Mery. This town he found occupied, much to his astonishment,
not by a feeble rear-guard of Schwartzenberg
but by a powerful division of Russians, commanded by
Sacken and therefore belonging to the apparently indestructible
army of Blucher. These unexpected enemies
were charged in the streets, and at length retired out of the
town,&mdash;which was burnt to the ground in the struggle,&mdash;and
thence beyond the Aube. The Emperor then halted,
and spent the night of the 22d of February in a charcoal
burner's cottage at Chatres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile negotiations were still pending at Chatillon.
Caulaincourt, receiving no answer to his second dispatch
sent to Napoleon at Nogent on the 8th of February, proceeded
to act on the instructions dated at Troyes on the
3d; and in effect accepted the basis of the Allies. When
Schwartzenberg was attacked at Nangis, on the 17th, he
had just received the intelligence of Caulaincourt's having
signed the preliminary articles, and he, therefore, sent a
messenger to ask why the Emperor, if aware of his
ambassador's act, persisted in hostilities; but received no
answer.</p>

<p>Napoleon sent instead a private letter to the Emperor
of Austria, once more trying to gain his friendship. The
reply of Francis, written to him from Nangis, reached
Napoleon at Chatres on the 23d. It announced Francis'
resolution on no account to abandon the general cause,
but declared that he lent no support to the Bourbonists,
and urged Napoleon to avert by concession, ere it was too
late, total ruin from himself and his House. Napoleon
returned the envoy with a note signifying that now he
would not consent to a day's armistice, unless the Allies
would fall back so as to leave Antwerp in their front.
The same evening news came from Paris that the Council
of State had discussed the proposals of the Allied Powers,
and with only one dissenting voice, now entreated the
Emperor to accept them. He was urged, anew, to send
to Chatillon and accept the basis to which Caulaincourt
had agreed. He answered that he had sworn at his coronation
to preserve the territory of the Republic entire,
and that he could not sign this treaty without violating
his oath. "If I am to be scourged" said he, "let the
whip come on me of necessity, and not through any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
voluntary stooping of my own." The truth of these
attempts at negotiation is that the Allies merely desired a
simple suspension of arms, in order to gain time to reinforce
themselves, and also in order to interrupt the too
rapid course of Napoleon's successes in the last eight
days. This the Emperor easily discerned through the
maze of the contrary declarations of the foreign negotiators,
and in fact is avowed by the historians of the
campaigns of the Allies.</p>

<p>Napoleon now resolved to push on as far as Troyes, at
the same time permitting proposals for an armistice to be
considered at Lusigny, and negotiations for peace to
proceed at Chatillon. The Emperor had meanwhile
requested Oudinot and Macdonald, with their divisions,
to manoeuvre in the direction of Schwartzenberg, in
order to keep the Austrians in check.</p>

<p>Napoleon learned at Troyes, in the night of the 26th of
February, that the Prussian army was in motion. His
resolution was soon taken. He again hastened to the
succor of his capital, and came, with the prodigious
celerity which rendered his marches and manoeuvres so
distinguishing, to fall upon the rear of Blucher, who still
had Marmont and Mortier in front. Marching rapidly
across the country to Sezanne he received intelligence
that these two generals, finding themselves inferior in
numbers to Blucher, had retired before him in the direction
of Ferté-sous-Jouarre, and were in full retreat to Meaux.
This point he considered as almost a suburb to Paris and
he quickened his speed accordingly. Hurrying on, at
Ferté-Goucher he was at once met and overtaken by
evil tidings. Schwartzenberg, having discovered the Emperor's
absence, had immediately assumed the offensive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
defeated Oudinot and Macdonald at Bar-sur-Aube on the
27th, and driven them before him as far as Troyes; and
Augereau, who commanded in the neighborhood of Lyons,
announced the arrival of a new and great army of the
Allies in that quarter. On the 1st of March an important
treaty was ratified at Chaumont between the sovereigns
of Austria, England, Russia and Prussia, by which
the four contracting powers bound themselves each to
maintain in the field an army of one hundred and fifty
thousand men until the objects of the war were attained;
England, as usual, engaging, over and above, to furnish
a subsidy of four millions sterling. In a second clause,
each of the four powers was bound never to make a separate
peace with the common enemy. About the same
time the commissioners at Lusigny broke up the negotiations
for an armistice, on the plea of inability to settle
the line of demarcation.</p>

<p>Napoleon's operations were not checked, however.
Having been detained for some time at Ferté, in consequence
of the destruction of the bridge, he took the direction
of Chateau Thierry and Soissons, where he hoped to
receive Blucher, while Mortier and Marmont received
orders to assume the offensive in front of Meaux. The
Emperor hoped in this manner to throw himself on the
flank of Blucher's march, as he had done before at Champaubert;
but the Prussian received intelligence of his
approach and drawing his troops together, retired to
Soissons. Napoleon proceeded thither with alacrity,
believing that the French garrison intrusted with the care of
that town, and its bridge over the Marne, was still in possession
of it, and would enable him, therefore, to force Blucher
into action with this formidable obstacle in his rear. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
did not know that Soissons had been taken by a Russian
corps, retaken by a French one and fallen once more into
the hands of the enemy, ere the Emperor came in sight
of it. He assaulted the place with much vigor but the
Russians repelled the attack. Learning that Blucher had
filed his main body through the town and posted himself
behind the Marne, Napoleon marched up the left bank of
the river and crossed it also at Bery.</p>

<p>A few leagues in front of this place, on the height of
Craonne, two Russian corps,&mdash;those of Sacken and Witzingerode,&mdash;were
already in position, and the Emperor lost
no time in charging them there, in the hope of destroying
them ere they could unite with Blucher. The battle of
Craonne began at 11 a. m. on the 7th of March and lasted
until 4 o'clock in the afternoon. The resistance of the enemy
was most stubborn and the Emperor was preparing for a
final effort, when suddenly the Russians began to retreat
and he remained master of the field. He followed them;
but they continued to withdraw having been ordered to
fall back on the plateau of Laon, in order to form thereon
the same line with Blucher, who was once more eager for
a decisive conflict,&mdash;having been reinforced by the vanguard
of Bernadotte's army.</p>

<p>On the 9th of March Napoleon found his enemy strongly
posted along an elevated ridge, covered with wood, and
further protected in front by a succession of terrace walls,&mdash;the
enclosures of vineyards. There was a heavy mist on
the lower ground and the French were advancing up the
hill ere their movement was discovered. They were met
by a storm of cannonade which broke their centre, and on
either flank the French were all but routed. On all points
they were repelled, except at the village of Athies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
where Marmont had some advantage. Night interrupted
the contest, and the armies bivouacked in full view of each
other. Napoleon, although he had suffered severely,
resolved to renew the attack and mounted his horse
accordingly at 4 o'clock in the morning of the 10th. At
that moment news came that Marmont's corps had just
been assaulted at Athies and were compelled to fly towards
Corbeny.</p>

<p>The battle of Laon continued, all day, however; Napoleon
was unable to turn his adversaries and on the 11th
he commenced his retreat, leaving thirty cannon and 10,000
men. Soissons had been evacuated by the allies when
concentrating themselves for the battle of Laon, and
Napoleon threw himself into that town, and was making
rapid efforts to strengthen it in expectation of the Prussian
advance, when he learned that a detached Russian corps
had seized Rheims.</p>

<p>The possession of this city could hardly fail to establish
Blucher's communications with Schwartzenberg, and
Napoleon instantly marched thither in person leaving
Marmont to hold out as well as he could in case that should
be the direction of Blucher's march. The Emperor came
upon Rheims with his usual rapidity and on the 13th took
the place by assault.</p>

<p>In this crisis, in which Napoleon was battling against
numbers overwhelmingly his superior, it is remarkable
to note the energy with which he turned from enemy
to enemy, and behold his fearless assaults on vastly
superior numbers, his unwearied resolution and exhaustless
invention. In his every movement he seemed a perfect
master of warfare; but he was battling against odds which
even his indomitable will, courage and foresight, could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
overcome. It should not be forgotten, also, that in addition
to this extraordinary series of campaigns, he continued to
conduct, from his perpetually changing quarters, the civil
business of his Empire.</p>

<p>The Allies, by a series of victories in various quarters,
were now, to all appearance, in full march upon Paris,
both by the valley of the Marne, and by that of the
Seine, at a moment when Napoleon had thought to defeat
their movements by taking up a position between them at
Rheims. When Schwartzenberg learned that the Emperor
was at this point his old terror returned, and the Austrian
instantly proposed to fall back from Troyes. This did
not please Lord Castlereagh who announced that the
Grand Army might retire if the sovereigns pleased, but
that if such a movement took place the subsidies of
England must be considered at an end. The Czar also
opposed the over-caution of Schwartzenberg, who then
took courage, and his columns instantly resumed their
march down the Seine, to offer battle to Napoleon at Arcis.</p>

<p>The Emperor was now struggling to decide which of
two courses to pursue; should he hasten after Blucher on
the Marne, what was to prevent Schwartzenberg from
reaching Paris ere the Silesians, already victorious at Laon,
could once more be brought to action by an inferior force:
should he throw himself on the march of Schwartzenberg,
would not the fiery Prussian be at the Tuileries long
before the Austrian could be checked on the Seine? There
remained a third course&mdash;namely, to push at once into the
country in the rear of the Grand Army and thus strike the
advancing Allies, both the Austrians and Prussians, with
terror, and paralyze their movements. Would they persist
in their cry, "On to Paris!" when they knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
Napoleon to be posting himself between them and their
resources, and at the same time relieving and rallying
around him all the garrisons of the great fortresses of the
Rhine? While Napoleon was thus tossed with anxiety
for means to avert, if it were yet possible, the visitation
of these mighty armies upon Paris, and unaware of
Castlereagh's very effective threat, the capital showed
small symptoms of sympathizing with him. The machinery
of government was clogged in every wheel, and the necessity
of purchasing peace by abandoning him was the
common burden of conversation.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Arrival of the Grand Army at Moscow</span></div>
</div>

<p>In this extreme situation, the gravity and peril of which
he measured with a glance, the Emperor felt that he could
only escape by a striking and decisive action, and he did
not hesitate to direct the intended blow towards Schwartzenberg,
whose approach already spread alarm throughout
the capital. The Emperor Alexander, on learning the
successes of Napoleon at Craonne and Rheims, had feared
that Schwartzenberg, by approaching the capital alone,
would be again beaten separately, and that all these daily
and isolated defeats would end by discouraging the troops
of the Coalition, already filled with apprehension and
alarm. The Czar, therefore, insisted in that council of war
held at Troyes, that the two grand allied armies should
forthwith manoeuvre so as to effect their junction in the
environs of Chalons, in order to march thence on Paris,
and crush everything which might be opposed to their
passage.</p>

<p>This advice had prevailed and Napoleon met, on the
20th, before Arcis, the entire army of Schwartzenberg,
which was bearing in a mass for this town, in order to
cross the Aube, and rapidly gain the plains of Champagne
where the junction was to be effected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p>This sudden change of system in the military operations
of the Allies completely disarranged all the plans of
Napoleon, who quickly perceived the difficult and perilous
position in which he was placed, by encountering an army
three times as strong as his own, where he had only
thought to find a rear-guard. However, he quickly decided
to take the chance by casting into the struggle the weight
of his own example, and reckoning his personal
dangers for nothing. His cavalry had orders to
attack the Austrian light troops while the infantry
debouched from Arcis; but they were repulsed by the
overpowering numbers opposed to them and driven back
upon the town. In this extremity, Napoleon evinced the
same heroic and almost reckless courage which he had
shown at Lodi and Arcola, and on other occasions. He
threw himself, sword in hand, among the broken cavalry,
called on them to remember their former victories, and
checked the enemy by an impetuous charge in which he
and his staff-officers fought hand to hand with the invaders.
"Surrounded in the crowd by the charges of cavalry,"
says Baron Fain, in a volume called "The Manuscript of
1814," giving an account of the engagement at Arcis, "he
freed himself only by making use of his sword. On
divers occasions, he fought at the head of his escort, and,
far from avoiding the dangers, he seemed, on the contrary,
to brave them. A shell fell at his feet; he awaited its
bursting, and disappeared in a cloud of dust and smoke;
he was believed to be lost; presently he arose, flung
himself upon another horse, and again went to place himself
beneath the fire of the batteries! *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Death would
have nothing to do with him!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of the prodigious efforts of the French army,
and the unchangeable heroism of its chief, the battle of
Arcis could not hinder the passage of the Aube, by the
Austrians. The Emperor retired in good order, on the
21st, after having done the enemy much harm, and
held him in check for a whole day; but Schwartzenberg
ended by gaining the road which was to conduct him to
Blucher.</p>

<p>Napoleon now decided on throwing himself upon
the rear of the Allies. They were for some time quite
uncertain of his movements after he quitted Rheims,
until an intercepted letter to Marie Louise informed them
that he was at St. Dizier, where Napoleon had slept on the
23d. He continued to manoeuvre on the country beyond
this point for several days. Having seized the roads by
which the Allies had advanced, he took many prisoners
of distinction on their way to headquarters and at one
time the Emperor of Austria himself escaped narrowly
a party of French hussars. At St. Dizier, Caulaincourt
rejoined the Emperor and announced to him the definite
rupture of the negotiations with the Allies. This, however,
was no surprise; but was expected. The only real
discomfiture it caused was among the malcontents in the
army, whose chief regret was at being from Paris,
and who asked each other, barely out of hearing of the
Emperor, "Where are we going? What is to become of
us? If he falls, shall we fall with him?"</p>

<p>On the 26th of March the distant roaring of artillery
was heard at intervals on the boulevards of Paris and the
alarm began to be violent. On Sunday the 27th, Joseph
Bonaparte held a review in the Place Carrousel. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
same evening the allies passed the Marne at various points
and at 3 o'clock in the morning they took Meaux. The
regular troops now marched out of the capital, leaving all
the barriers in charge of the National Guard. On the
29th the Empress, her son, and most of the members of
the Council of State, set off attended by 700 soldiers, for
Rambouillet from which they continued their journey to
Blois. Queen Hortense, afflicted at seeing the Empress-Regent
and her son abandon the capital to intriguers and
conspirators, strongly pressed her to remain, and said with
a prophetic conviction: "If you leave the Tuileries, you
will never see them again!"</p>

<p>"One of the most astonishing circumstances of the
moment," says Pons de L' Herault, a historian of the
period, "is undeniably, the obstinacy with which the King
of Rome refused to depart. This obstinacy was so great,
that it became necessary to use violence in order to remove
the young prince. The cries of the infant-king were
heart-rending. He repeated several times: 'My father
told me not to go away!' All the spectators shed tears."
The young prince had declared again and again that "his
papa was betrayed" and his declaration has never been
satisfactorily accounted for and can only be explained by
the supposition that he had heard the subject discussed
among those who considered that all was lost in abandoning
the capital.</p>

<p>Joseph now published the following proclamation:
"Citizens of Paris! A hostile column has descended on
Meaux. It advances; but the Emperor follows close
behind, at the head of a victorious army. The Council
of Regency has provided for the safety of the Empress and
the King of Rome. I remain with you. Let us arm our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>selves
to defend this city, its monuments, its riches, our
wives, our children&mdash;all that is dear to us. Let this vast
capital become a camp for some moments; and let the
enemy find his shame under the walls which he hopes to
overleap in triumph. The Emperor marches to our succor.
Second him by a short and vigorous resistance, and preserve
the honor of France."</p>

<p>The appeal did not produce the results hoped for. Some
officers urged Savary to have the streets unpaved and
persuade the people to arm themselves with stones and
prepare for a defense such as Saragossa. He answered,
shaking his head, "the thing cannot be done."</p>

<p>On the 30th the Allies fought and won the final battle.
The French occupied the whole of the range of heights
from the Marne at Charenton, to the Seine beyond
St. Denis; the Austrians beginning the attack about 11
o'clock towards the former of these points, while nearly
in the midst between them, a charge was made by the
Russians on Pantin and Belleville. The French troops of
the line were commanded by Marmont and Mortier; those
battalions of the National Guard, whose spirit could be
trusted, and who were adequately armed, took their orders
from Marshal Moncey and formed a second line of defense.
The scholars of the Polytechnic School volunteered to
serve at the great guns, and the artillery though weak in
numbers, was well arranged. At the barrier of Clichy, in
particular, the Allies met with a spirited resistance. The
pattern of the French soldiers, the brave Moncey, was
there, with his son, and with him Allent, the leader of
his staff; celebrated artists and distinguished writers
surrounded him and shared his perils. Among the former
was Horace Vernet whose Napoleonic pictures have since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
become famous in two continents. The defense of the
city, while brave and determined was ineffectual, and
courage was at length compelled to yield to numbers.</p>

<p>By 2 o'clock the Allies were victorious at all points
except Montmartre. Marmont then sent several aides-de-camp
to request an armistice and offer a capitulation in
order to save the capital. The Czar and the King of
Prussia professed their willingness to spare the city, provided
the regular troops would evacuate it.</p>

<p>Blucher meanwhile continued pressing on at Montmartre
and shortly after 4 o'clock, the victory being completed
in that direction, the French cannon were turned
on the city and shot and shells began to spread destruction
within its walls. The capitulation was drawn up at 5
o'clock, close to the barrier St. Denis.</p>

<p>It was not until the 27th that Napoleon distinctly
ascertained the fact of both the allied armies having
marched directly on Paris. He instantly resolved to hasten
after them, in hopes of arriving on their rear ere they had
mastered the heights of Montmartre. Arriving at Doulevent
on the 29th he received a message from Lavalette,
his Post-Master General, who wrote: "The partisans
of the Stranger are making head, aided by secret intrigues.
The presence of the Emperor is indispensable&mdash;if he
desires to prevent his capital from being delivered to the
enemy. There is not a moment to be lost!"</p>

<p>Urging his advance accordingly, Napoleon reached
Troyes on the night of the 29th, his men having marched
fifteen leagues since daybreak. General Dejean, his aide-de-camp,
rode on before him bound for Paris to announce
to the Parisians that the Emperor flew to succor them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 30th Macdonald attempted to convince him that
the fate of Paris must have been decided ere he could reach
it, and advised him to march, without further delay, so as
to form a conjunction with Augereau. "In that case,"
said the marshal, "we may unite and repose our troops,
and yet give the enemy battle on a chosen field. If Providence
has decreed our last hour, we shall at least die with
honor, instead of being dispersed, pillaged and slaughtered
by Cossacks."</p>

<p>The Emperor was unwilling to abide by the counsel of
his marshal, but continued to advance; finding the road
beyond Troyes clear he threw himself into a postchaise
and traveled on before his army at full speed. At
Villeneuve L'Archereque he mounted on horseback and
galloping without a pause, reached Fontainebleau late at
night. Here he ordered a carriage, and taking Caulaincourt
and Berthier, drove on towards Paris. He was still
of the belief that he was yet in time&mdash;until, while he was
changing horses at an inn called "La Cour de France,"
but a few miles from Paris, General Belliard came up, at
the head of a weary column of cavalry marching towards
Fontainebleau, in consequence of the provisions of Marmont's
treaty with the Allies. He was too late! Paris
had capitulated!</p>

<p>Leaping from his carriage as the words reached his
ears, the Emperor exclaimed, "What means this? Why
here with your cavalry, Belliard? And where are the
enemy? Where are my wife and boy? Where Marmont?
Where Mortier?"</p>

<p>Belliard, walking by his side, told him of the events of
the day. Still the Emperor insisted on continuing his
journey although again informed there was no longer an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
army in Paris; that the regulars were all coming behind,
and that neither they nor he himself, having left the city
in consequence of a convention, could possibly return to
it. It seemed impossible for him to comprehend the
astounding intelligence of Belliard who said; "Paris is surrounded
by one hundred and thirty thousand enemies."</p>

<p>Napoleon bade Belliard turn with his cavalry and follow
him. "Come" said he "we must return to Paris,&mdash;nothing
goes aright when I am away&mdash;they do nothing but blunder!"
As he progressed he continued, "You should have
held out longer&mdash;you should have raised Paris&mdash;they cannot
like the Cossacks&mdash;they would surely have defended
their walls. Go! Go! I see everyone has lost his senses.
This comes of employing fools and cowards."</p>

<p>The Emperor and Belliard continued Paris-ward, until
they were met, a mile beyond the post-house, by the first
column of the retreating infantry. Their commander,
General Curial, reiterated what Belliard had said. "In
proceeding to Paris," he said, "you rush on to death or
captivity." The Emperor then became at once perfectly
composed and abandoned his design, gave orders that the
troops, as they arrived, should draw up behind the little
river Essonne, and dispatched Caulaincourt to Paris to
ascertain if it were yet possible for him to interpose in the
treaty. Having taken this measure he turned back
towards Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>Caulaincourt reached the Czar's quarters at Pantin
early in the morning of the 31st of March where he found
a deputation from the municipality of Paris waiting to
present the keys of the city and invoke the protection of
the conqueror. The Czar received them immediately on
arriving and promised that the capital, and all within it,
should be treated with perfect consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>Caulaincourt then found his way to Alexander; but he
was dismissed immediately. The Allies had practically
agreed in favoring the restoration of the Bourbons, ere
any part of their forces entered the capital, and a proclamation
signed, "Schwartzenberg, Commander of the Chief
of the Allied Armies" was distributed throughout Paris
in which there were many phrases not to be reconciled
with any other position. The royalists welcomed with
exultation the dawn of the 31st and issued proclamations of
their own appealing for restoration, besides parading the
streets without interruption from either the civil authorities
or of the National Guard, although decorated with
the symbols of their cause.</p>

<p>At noon the first of the Allied troops began to pass the
barrier and enter the city, and the triumphal procession
lasted for several hours. Fifty thousand troops, horse,
foot and artillery, marched along the boulevards and in
their midst appeared the youthful Czar and the King of
Prussia, followed by a dazzling suite of princes, ambassadors
and generals.</p>

<p>The Czar repaired to the hotel of Talleyrand where a
council was convened. Alexander and Frederick were
urged to re-establish the House of Bourbon. They hesitated:
"It is but a few days ago" said the Czar, "since
a column of five or six thousand troops suffered themselves to
be cut in pieces before my eyes, when a single
cry of '<i>Vive le Roi!</i>' would have saved them." One of those
present answered "Such things will go on as long as you
continue to treat with Bonaparte even although at this
moment he has a halter round his neck." The Czar did
not understand this allusion until it was explained to him
that the Parisians were busy pulling down Napoleon's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
statue from the top of the great pillar in the Place
Vendome.</p>

<p>Alexander now signed a proclamation asserting the
resolution of the Allies "to treat no more with Napoleon
Bonaparte, or any of his family." That same evening
the Czar, by his minister, declared that "Louis XVIII
will immediately ascend the throne." A few days later
myriads of hands were busy in every corner of the city
pulling down the statues and pictures and effacing the
arms of Napoleon.</p>

<p>Caulaincourt returned to Fontainebleau in the night
between the 2d and 3d of April and informed Napoleon
that the monarchs he had so often spared, and whose
royal destinies he could have closed after Austerlitz,
Jena, and Wagram, refused to treat with him,&mdash;and
demanded his abdication. He added that the Allies had
not yet, in his opinion, made up their minds to resist the
scheme of a regency, but that he was commissioned to
say that nothing could be arranged as to ulterior questions,
until he, the Emperor, had formally abdicated.</p>

<p>Napoleon was not yet prepared to give up his
throne; the news both irritated him and made him indignant.
He again wished to try the lot of arms; but his old
companions-in-arms declared they would take no further
part in the war. The next day, the 4th of April, he
reviewed some of his troops, addressed them on "the
treasonable proceedings in the capital," and announced
his intention of instantly marching thither, being answered
by shouts of "Paris! Paris!" Nearly 50,000 men were
now stationed around Fontainebleau. On parade, Napoleon
looked pale and thoughtful, while his convulsive motions
manifested his internal struggles, and he did not stop many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
minutes. On retiring to the chateau, after the review, the
Emperor was followed by his marshals, who informed him
that if he refused to negotiate on the basis of his personal
abdication, and persisted in risking an attack on Paris,
they would not accompany him. He paused for a moment
in silence&mdash;then a long debate ensued, ending in his drawing
up and signing the following: <i>The Allied Powers
having proclaimed that the Emperor Napoleon was the sole
obstacle to the re-establishment of peace in Europe, he, faithful
to his oath, declares that he is ready to descend from the
throne, to quit France, and even to relinquish life, for the
good of his country; which is inseparable from the rights of
his Son, from those of the Regency in the person of the
Empress, and from the maintenance of the laws of the
Empire.</i></p>

<p><i>Done at our Palace of Fontainebleau, April the 4th, 1814.</i></p>

<div class="sigright"><span class="smcap">Napoleon.</span></div>

<p>Caulaincourt was appointed to bear this document to
Paris and the marshals proposed that Ney should accompany
him. It was suggested that Marmont should also
form a part of the deputation but he being in command
at Essonne, Macdonald was named in his stead. The
officers now desired to know on what stipulations, as
concerned the Emperor personally, they were to insist.
"On none," he answered; "obtain the best terms you can
for France&mdash;for myself I ask nothing." They then
departed.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Napoleon asked Oudinot if the
troops would follow him. "No, Sire" answered the
marshal, "you have abdicated."</p>

<p>"Yes, upon certain conditions."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>"The soldiers" resumed Oudinot, "do not comprehend
the difference; they think you have no more any right to
command them."</p>

<p>"Well then," said Napoleon, "it is no more to be
thought of; let us wait for accounts from Paris."</p>

<p>Marmont, whom he had loaded with favors, had in the
meantime joined the Allies, and by a nocturnal march of
his army passed over into the midst of the enemy,
enabling them to appear more exacting than ever, and
which caused Napoleon to denounce his treason to the
army by an order of the day in which he scanned the
conduct of the Senate who had also, on April 2d, declared
Napoleon Bonaparte and his family expelled from the
throne of France. "Marshal Marmont's desertion was a
mortal blow to the Imperial cause," says Meneval. "It
decided the Emperor Alexander, who till then had
appeared to hesitate on the question of a regency, to exact
in the name of the Allied Powers, the unconditional abdication
of the Emperor." Talleyrand said dryly, when
someone called Marmont a traitor, "his watch only went
a little faster than the others," and in this he spoke truthfully,
for officers of all ranks now rapidly abandoned the
camp at Fontainebleau, and presented themselves to swear
allegiance to the new government, impatient to enjoy in
peace the honors and riches with which Napoleon had
loaded them.</p>

<p>Caulaincourt, Ney and Macdonald, on being admitted to
the presence of the Czar, the act of abdication was produced.
Alexander was surprised that it should have
contained no stipulations for Napoleon personally; "but
I have been his friend" said he "and I will willingly be
his advocate. I propose that he shall retain his imperial
title, with the sovereignty of Elba, or some other island."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>When Napoleon's envoys retired from the presence of
the Czar it still remained doubtful whether the abdication
would be accepted in its present form, or the Allies would
insist on an unconditional surrender. At length they
signified their intention to accept of nothing but an
unconditional abdication. These terms were finally borne
by the marshals to their waiting chief. The marshals
returned in the night about twelve. Ney entered first:
"Well, have you succeeded?", said Napoleon.</p>

<p>"Revolutions do not retrograde," answered the veteran
marshal, "this has begun its course; it was too late:
tomorrow the Senate will recognize the Bourbons."</p>

<p>"Where shall I be able to live with my family?"</p>

<p>"Where your Majesty pleases; for example, in the isle
of Elba, with a revenue of six millions."</p>

<p>"Six millions! that is a great deal for a soldier as I am.
I see very well I must submit."</p>

<p>The form of abdication submitted by the marshals was
to the following purport:</p>

<p>1st. The imperial title to be preserved by Napoleon,
with the free sovereignty of Elba, guards, and a navy
suitable to the extent of that island; a pension, from
France, of six millions of francs annually.</p>

<p>2d. The Duchies of Parma, Placentia and Guastalla
to be granted in sovereignty to Marie Louise and her
heirs, and</p>

<p>3d. Two millions and a half of francs annually to be
paid, by the French government, in pensions to Josephine
and other members of the Bonaparte family.</p>

<p>Napoleon hesitated when he received the formal ultimatum
of the invading powers. He thought seriously of
continuing the war, but the group of his personal followers
had been rapidly thinned by desertion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 11th of April he at length abandoned all hope
and the next day executed an instrument called the treaty
of Fontainebleau formally "renouncing for himself and
his heirs, the thrones of France and Italy." Concerning
the act Napoleon said, "I blush for it; what avails
a treaty, since they will not settle the interests of France
with me. If only my personal interests are concerned,
there is no need of a treaty. I am conquered; I yield to
the fate of arms. All I ask is, not to be accounted a
prisoner of war." To all suggestions referring to his
providing for his future wants he replied, "What matters
it? A horse and a crown a day are all I want!"</p>

<p>"Napoleon, when he affixed his name to the abdication"
says Baron Fain, his secretary, "made two or three
scratches, and a dent, with the stump of his pen, or back
of a knife, on the little, round, claw-footed, yellow table,
on which it was signed. After the resignation of the
Empire, he spent his time either in conversation in his
apartment, or in a small English garden at the back of the
palace.... Napoleon, during those days of distress,
was seated alone for hours and amused himself by
kicking a hole, a foot deep, with his heel, in the gravel
beneath.... At the moment of Bonaparte's abdication,
he remarked that instruments of destruction had
been left in his way; he seemed to think that they were
placed there purposely, in order that he might attempt his
own life; and with a sardonic smile, said, 'Self-murder
is sometimes committed for love&mdash;what folly! Sometimes
for the loss of fortune&mdash;there it is <i>cowardice</i>! Another
cannot live after he has been disgraced&mdash;<i>what weakness</i>!
But to survive the loss of Empire, to be exposed to the
results of one's contemporaries,&mdash;<i>that is true courage</i>!'"</p>

EXILE TO ELBA</h2>

<p class="p2">The armies of the Allies had gradually pushed forward
from Paris and now nearly surrounded Fontainebleau.
When the last of the marshals had quitted Napoleon's
presence for the night, after imperiously demanding his
resignation, he revolted at the humiliations he had to
undergo and disgusted at their cowardice, exclaimed:
"These men have neither hearts nor entrails. I am
conquered less by fortune than by the selfishness and
ingratitude of my brothers-in-arms!" The same night,
in a fit of despair he swallowed a weak poison contained
in a bag that he had worn around his neck since 1808.
The palace was aroused by his cries and Dr. Yvan hastily
summoned by his valet. An antidote was given him and
his life saved. To Caulaincourt he said an hour later:
"God would not allow it. I could not die. Why did they
not let me die? It is not the loss of my throne that
makes existence insupportable to me. My military
career is enough glory for one man. Do you know what
is more difficult to bear than reverses of fortune? It is
the baseness, the horrible ingratitude of men. I turned
my head away with horror from the sight of their meanness
and their contemptible selfishness, and I am disgusted
with life. What I have suffered during the last three
weeks, no one can tell."</p>

<p>Some months later, while at Elba, Napoleon ascribed
his ruin entirely to Marmont, to whom he had confided
some of his best troops, and a post of the greatest impor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>tance,
as a person on whose devotion to him he could most
depend. "For how could I expect to be betrayed," he
said, "by a man whom I had loaded with kindness from
the time he was fifteen years of age? Had he stood firm,
I could have driven the Allies out of Paris, and the
people there,&mdash;as well as throughout France,&mdash;would have
risen, in spite of the Senate, if they had had a few troops
to support them."</p>

<p>The Emperor remained long enough at Fontainebleau
to hear of the restoration of the Bourbon Monarchy, and
on the 20th of April, the commissioners of the Allied
Sovereigns having arrived, he once more called his loyal
officers about him and signified that they were summoned
to receive his last adieu. A few of the marshals and
others who had sworn fealty to the new monarch were also
present. "Louis" (the King), Napoleon said, "has talents
and means: he is old and infirm; and will not, I think,
choose to give a bad name to his reign. If he is wise,
he will occupy my bed, and only change the sheets. He
must treat the army well, and take care not to look back
on the past, or his time will be brief. For you, gentlemen,
I am no longer to be with you;&mdash;you have another
government; and it will become you to attach yourselves to
it frankly, and serve it faithfully as you have served me."</p>

<p>As he passed along he beheld all that now remained of
the most brilliant and numerous courts in Europe, reduced
to about sixteen individuals, who thus waited to manifest
their regard and respect for the fallen Emperor. Junot,
had died the year before, and Caulaincourt and General
Flahault were absent on missions. Napoleon shook
hands with them all; then hastily passing the range of
carriages, he advanced towards the relics of the Imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
Guard which he had desired to be drawn up in the courtyard
of the castle. He advanced to them on horseback
and tears dropped from his eyes as he dismounted in
their midst. "Soldiers of the Old Guard," said he,
"I bid you farewell! During twenty years you have
been my constant companions in the path of honor and
glory. In our last disasters, as well as in the days
of our prosperity, you invariably proved yourselves
models of courage and fidelity. With such men as you,
our cause could not have been lost; but a protracted
civil war would have ensued, and the miseries of France
would thereby have been augmented. I have, therefore,
sacrificed all our interests to those of the country. I depart:
you, my friends, will continue to serve France, whose
happiness has ever been the only object of my thoughts,
and still will be the sole object of my wishes. Do not
deplore my fate. If I consent to live, it is that I may
still contribute to your glory. I will record the great
achievements we have performed together. Farewell, my
comrades! I should wish to press you all to my bosom.
Let me at least embrace your standard."</p>

<p>At these words, General Petit took the eagle and came
forward. Napoleon received the general in his arms, and
kissed the flag. The silence of this affecting scene was
only interrupted by the occasional sobs of the soldiers.
Having kissed the flag, Napoleon said with great emotion,
"Farewell once more my old comrades! Let this kiss be
impressed on all your hearts!"</p>

<p>On this occasion the English commissioner who stood
near him, and had previously been his inveterate enemy,
was so deeply moved that he was affected in the same
degree as Napoleon's attendants. When leaving Napoleon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
called for Rustan, his Mameluke servant, but the latter had
concealed himself, though on the preceding day he had
received from his master, at Fontainebleau, a present of
30,000 francs to provide for his wife and family during his
absence. The Emperor, in speaking afterwards of this
man who nightly slept across his doorway, said, "I am
by no means astonished at his conduct, as he was imbued
with the sentiments of a slave; and, finding me no longer
master, he imagined his services might be dispensed
with."</p>

<p>Napoleon now hurried through the group that surrounded
him&mdash;stepped into his carriage, and instantly
drove off. The carriages took the road to Lyons.</p>

<p>Four commissioners, one each from the great Allied
Powers, Austria, Russia, Prussia and England, accompanied
him on his journey. He was attended by the
ever faithful Bertrand, Grand Master of the Palace, and
some other attached friends and servants. While fourteen
carriages were conveying him and his immediate
suite towards Elba, 700 infantry and about 150 cavalry of
the Imperial Guard,&mdash;all picked men and volunteers,&mdash;marched
in the same direction to take on them the
military duties of the exiled court.</p>

<p>Not far from Lyons Napoleon met Augereau, general-in-chief
of the Army of the East, whose conduct during
the late campaign had been that of a traitor. When
Augereau had taken his leave from his ex-chief one of
the commissioners ventured to express surprise that
Napoleon should have treated him with such a show of
affection. "Why should I not?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty is perhaps unacquainted with his conduct.
Sire, he entered into an understanding with us
several weeks ago!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>The Emperor afterwards confirmed this anecdote,
adding: "The conqueror of Castiglione might have left
behind him a name dear to his country; but France will
execrate the memory of the traitor of Lyons."</p>

<p>During the early part of his progress the Exile was
received respectfully by the civil functionaries of the
different towns and departments, and many tokens of
sympathy on the part of the people were expressed. As
he increased the distance between himself and his capital,
and was carried into provinces wherein his name had
never been extremely popular, he was once or twice subjected
to personal insult, and danger of violence, when the
horses were changing. At Lyons, an old woman in mourning,
and with a countenance full of enthusiasm, rushed
forward to the door of the carriage. "Sire" said she,
with an air of solemnity, "may the blessing of heaven
attend your endeavor to make yourself happy. They
tear you from us; but our hearts are with you, wheresoever
you go."</p>

<p>The Austrian commissioner, quite disconcerted, said to
his companion, "Let us go; I have no patience with this
mad woman!"</p>

<p>At length Napoleon disguised himself and sometimes
appearing in an Austrian uniform, at others riding on
before the carriages in the garb of a courier, reached in
safety the place of embarkation. A French vessel had
been sent round from Toulon to Cannes, for the purpose
of conveying him to Elba; but there happened to be an
English frigate also in the roads and he preferred sailing
under any flag rather than the Bourbon. The voyage to
Elba was uneventful. Napoleon succeeded in making a
favorable impression on the English crew and when, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
finally leaving the "Undaunted," he caused some two hundred
napoleons ($800) to be distributed among the sailors,
the boatswain undertook to return thanks in the name of
the crew by "wishing him a long life&mdash;<i>and better luck next
time</i>!" As he left the vessel a royal salute was fired.</p>

<p>The Emperor of the little island of Elba came in view
of his new dominions on the afternoon of May 4th, 1814,
and went ashore in disguise the same evening, in order to
ascertain for himself whether the feelings of the Elbans
were favorable or otherwise. He found the people considered
his residence as likely to increase in every way the
importance and prosperity of their island, and returned on
board the ship; at noon the day following he made his
public entry into the town of Porto-Ferrajo amidst many
popular demonstrations of welcome and respect. The
English and Austrian commissioners landed with him,
those from Russia and Prussia having departed at the
coast of Provence. When the Exile climbed to the hill
above Ferrajo, and looked down upon the whole of his
territory, as upon a map, he remarked to Sir Neil Campbell,
the English commissioner, "It must be confessed
that my island is very small."</p>

<p>The island, however, mountainous and rocky, for the
most part barren, and of a circumference not
exceeding sixty miles, was his. He forthwith devoted
to it the same anxious care and industry that
had sufficed for the whole affairs of France, and a large
portion of Europe besides. In less than three weeks
he had thorougly acquainted himself with its history,
resources and the character of its people, had explored
every corner of the island "and projected more improvements
of all sorts" according to one historian, "than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
would have occupied a life-time to complete." He even
extended his "Empire" by sending some soldiers to take
possession of a small adjacent islet, hitherto unoccupied
for fear of Corsairs. He established residences in four
different corners of Elba and was continually in motion
from one to the other. All the etiquette of the
Tuileries was adhered to as far as possible, and Napoleon's
eight or nine hundred veterans were reviewed as frequently
and formally as if they had been the army of Austerlitz
or Friedland, and over which hung the flag of Elba
which the Emperor had adopted, and which was that of
the island,&mdash;white, striped with purple and studded with
stars. Sometime later he adopted a new flag as King of
Elba; silver with a red band, the latter having bees of
gold on it. The Emperor wore the uniform of the
Colonel of the Horse Chasseurs of the Guard. He had
substituted on his chapeau the red and white cockade of
the island for the tri-colored cockade. His presence gave
a new stimulus to the trade and industry of the island
and the port of Ferrajo was crowded with vessels from
the opposite coast of Italy.</p>

<p>Napoleon received no money whatever from the
Bourbon court, his pension having been entirely forgotten
by his successors at the capital. His complaints on this
head were not even considered, and the exchequer of the
Exile being rapidly depleted by his generous expenditures,
he soon became in need of many necessities. These new
troubles imbittered the spirit of the fallen Chief and but
for the course of events at Paris, of which he was kept
fully advised, would have become overpowered by a listlessness
which at one time affected him seriously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>While on the island the Emperor observed that his new
flag had become the first in the Mediterranean. It was
held sacred, he said, by the Algerians, who usually made
presents to the Elban captains, telling them they were
paying the debt of Moscow. Some Algerian ships once
anchoring off the island, great alarm was caused among
the inhabitants, who questioned the pirates, and asked
them plainly whether they came with any hostile views.
"Against the Great Napoleon;" they replied, "Oh!
never; we do not wage war on God!"</p>

<p>Louis XVIII. had made his public entry into Paris on
the 21st of April. He was advanced in years, gross and
infirm in person, yet he was, perhaps, less unpopular than
the rest of his family; but it was his fatal misfortune to
continue to increase day by day the bitterness of those who
had never been sincerely his friends. The King had been
called to the throne by the French Senate in a decree
which provided that he should preserve the political
system "which Napoleon had violated," and which
declared the legislative constitution as composed of a
hereditary sovereign and two houses of assembly; to be
fixed and unchangeable. Louis, however, though he
proceeded to France on this invitation, did not hesitate to
date his first act in the twentieth year of his reign. The
Senate saw in such assumptions the traces of those old
doctrines of "the divine right of kings," of which Louis
was a shining example, and which they, who though
not originally of his party, had consented to his recall&mdash;although
they had through life abhorred and combatted
such principles; and they asked themselves, why, if all
their privileges were but the gifts of the King, they might
not, on any tempting opportunity, be withdrawn by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
same authority. They, whose titles had all been won
since the death of Louis XVI., were startled when they
found, that, according to the royal doctrine, <i>there had
been no legitimate government all that time in France</i>!</p>

<p>The first tumult of the Restoration being over, and the
troops of the Allies withdrawn, things began to so shape
themselves that there were many elements of discontent
amongst all classes, one of the most powerful of which
was in the army itself. The Allies had restored, without
stipulation, the whole of the prisoners who had fallen
into their hands during the war. At least 150,000 veteran
soldiers, all of whom had fought under Napoleon on
many battlefields, were thus poured into France ere Louis
was well seated on the throne; men, too, who had
witnessed nothing of the last disastrous campaigns; who
had sustained themselves in their exile by recounting their
earlier victories; and who now, returning fresh and
vigorous to their native soil, had but one answer to every
tale of misfortune which met them: "These things
could never have happened had we been here!"</p>

<p>The Empress Marie was at Blois at the time Napoleon
signed his abdication, and Savary has described her grief as
very great, but her own reverses were sufficiently severe to
account for this, without any strong feeling for Napoleon.
By direction of Napoleon she applied for protection to the
Emperor of Austria and went to Rambouillet to meet him,
where he explained to her that she was to be separated
from her husband "for a time." The Emperor Alexander
visited her also, very much against her will, and a few
days afterwards she departed for Vienna. Alexander
also visited Josephine, and found her distress at Napoleon's
abdication very great. She appears never to have recovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
from the shock for she survived it only about six weeks.
She died on the 29th of May, 1814, at Malmaison, and was
buried in the church of Ruel. Her funeral was attended
by several generals of the allied armies, and marshals and
generals of France. The body was afterwards placed in
a magnificent tomb of white marble, erected by her two
children, and bearing the simple inscription: "Eugene
and Hortense to Josephine."</p>

<p>Napoleon's mother, and sister Pauline, as well as a
number of ancient and attached servants of his civil
government and his army, visited him during the
summer of 1814. Not the least of these was Pauline,
who made repeated voyages to Italy, and returned again
as mysteriously. In the circles of Ferrajo new and busy
faces now appeared and disappeared&mdash;no one knew whence
they had come or whither they went and an air of bustle
and mystery pervaded the atmosphere of the place. The
Emperor continued to review his handful of veteran
soldiers with as much pride as if they had been the
innumerable hosts he had led to victory on the Continent,
and seemed to be fairly well contented with his situation
notwithstanding he had fallen from an eminence that had
been reached by no other man in modern times. The
only notable change observed in his habits was that he
became grave, and reserved, and seemed no longer to take
any interest in the improvements he had effected on the
island.</p>

<p>It was evident, however, that something was preparing;
but the commissioners who watched over Napoleon were
unable to fathom it. They repeatedly remarked on the
absurdity of the Allied Powers in withholding his pension,
which they had solemnly pledged should be paid every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
quarter, thereby tempting him to release himself; but
their reports were left unnoticed by those in whose hands
they fell. This obliged the Emperor to sell every luxury
and comfort around him to raise the means of paying
his current expenses. Then it was that he began to
forecast the future and to contemplate a bold stroke, not
only for liberty, but to regain his lost throne before he
could be transported to St. Helena which he had been
informed privately was being discussed at Vienna.</p>

<p>In this he was aided by a nation which was far from
satisfied with the man whose possession of the royal
sceptre had only been made possible by the force of
foreign armies, and it was apparent to nearly everyone
that Louis XVIII. could not long rule France tranquilly,
even though Napoleon did not return.</p>

<p>Ere autumn closed Napoleon granted furloughs on various
pretexts to about two hundred of his Guard, and these
at once scattered themselves over France singing his
praises. It now began to be whispered that the Exile would
return to the soil of France in the spring of the coming year.
Among the soldiery and elsewhere he was toasted under
the <i>sobriquet</i> of "Corporal Violet," a flower or a ribbon
of its color being the symbol of rebellion, and worn openly
in the sight of the unsuspecting Bourbons. It was by this
secret symbol that Napoleon's friends knew each other.
Rings of a violet color with the device, "It will re-appear
in the spring," became fashionable; women wore violet-colored
silks and the men displayed watch-strings of the
same color; while the mutual question when these friends
met was generally, "Are you fond of the violet?" to
which the answer of a confederate was, "Ah! well."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>The representatives of all the European princes had
met in Vienna to settle finally a number of questions left
undecided at the termination of the war, including a
division of the "spoils." Talleyrand was there for France,
Wellington for England, Metternich for Austria. On the
11th of March these representatives, who were then
discussing among other things "how to get rid of the
Man of Elba," were thrown into a panic by the news that
Napoleon Bonaparte had reared his standard once more
in France and was marching on Paris!</p>

<p>Of the state of affairs in France Napoleon had been
fully advised as well as of the sessions of the ministers at
the Congress of Vienna, who had suggested that, as the
French government would not honestly pay his pension,
he should be taken to some place of greater safety, and
St. Helena was even mentioned at this time. This
determined Napoleon to act, especially as he was fully
convinced that he had a good chance of being well
received by the twenty or thirty millions of people who
were being treated with contempt by Louis XVIII. and
his followers. The arrival also of M. Fleury de Chaboulon,
with secret messages from Maret, (Duke of Bassano) then
at Paris, had much to do with the hasty determination of
Napoleon to quit Elba at the earliest moment possible.
Reserved as the Exile was with others he told his mother
of his plans. "I cannot die on this island," he said to
her, "and terminate my career in a repose unworthy of
me. Besides, want of money would soon leave me here
alone, exposed to the attack of my enemies." His mother
reflected for some time in silence and then replied, "Go,
my son&mdash;go and fulfill your destiny! You will fail
perhaps, and your failure will soon be followed by your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
death. But I see with sorrow that you cannot remain
here; let us hope that God, who has protected you amid
so many battles, will save you once more!"</p>

<p>Bertrand, who was sharing Napoleon's exile, was now
informed of the Emperor's decision as was also Druot
who at once commenced secret preparations for the
approaching expedition. Eleven hundred soldiers were
collected of whom 800 belonged to the Guard and 300
to the 35th light infantry that Napoleon had found in
the island. None of these men had any idea of the
projected enterprise. Colonel Campbell, who was watching
proceedings in Elba for the English, had left Ferrajo
and gone to Leghorn. There remained then only the
cruisers that were easily deceived or avoided. In order
to keep his preparations a profound secret, Napoleon,
two days before embarking, laid an embargo on the
vessels in the harbors of Elba, and cut off all communication
with the sea. He then ordered his ordnance officer,
Vantini, to seize one of the large vessels lying in the port,
which, with the "Inconstant" of twenty-six cannon,
and six other smaller craft, making in all seven vessels, he
secured the means of embarking his eleven hundred men
and four pieces of field artillery. He had decided to
commence his romantic enterprise on the 26th of February,
1815. On this day he allowed his soldiers to remain at
their usual employment until the middle of the day.
They were suddenly summoned in the afternoon and after
being lightly fed, were assembled with arms and baggage
on the pier where they were informed that they were to
go on board the vessels. The inhabitants of the island
regretted the Exile's departure as they feared its prosperity
would go with him. Napoleon's staff and about three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
hundred men embarked on board the "Inconstant," the
others being distributed in the other vessels of the flotilla.</p>

<p>The discharge of a single cannon at about 7 o'clock in
the evening was the signal agreed upon for weighing
anchor, and when the sails were unfurled, and the little
fleet steered its course, reiterated cries of "Paris or
death!" were heard from the exultant troops. The
Emperor had said to them, "Grenadiers! we are going
to France; we must march to Paris!"</p>

<p>The English commissioner immediately attempted to
get Napoleon's mother and sister to betray his destination
and being unsuccessful, at once pursued; but was unable to
overtake his charge. On the voyage a French ship-of-war
crossed his path; but the Emperor made all his
soldiers and those persons who could be suspected descend
under the deck, and the steersman of the "Inconstant,"
who happened to be well acquainted with the commanding
officer, had received and answered the usual challenge
without exciting any suspicion. In reply to the question
of how they left the Emperor at Elba, Napoleon himself
made answer by signal that, "He was very well."</p>

<p>During the voyage he dictated two proclamations which
were copied by almost all his soldiers and attendants who
could write. These were to be duplicated on landing and
distributed throughout France.</p>

<p>The Emperor, having left Elba on the 26th of February,
arrived off Cannes, near Fréjus, on March 1st,&mdash;the very
spot he had touched when he arrived from Egypt, and
from which he had embarked ten months before.
He landed without opposition, and his handful of
men,&mdash;500 grenadiers of the Guard, 200 dragoons and
100 Polish lancers, these last without horses and carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
their saddles on their backs, were reviewed and immediately
began their march on Paris. He bivouacked
that night in a plantation of olives, with all his men
about him. As soon as the moon rose, the reveillé
sounded. A laborer who was going thus early to work
in the fields recognized the Emperor's person, and uttering
a cry of joy, said he had served in the Army of Italy and
would join the ranks. "Here is a reinforcement already!"
said Napoleon to Bertrand, and after spending the balance
of the evening in chatting familiarly with his Guard, the
march towards Paris recommenced.</p>

<p>Early in the morning they passed through the town of
Grasse, and halted on the height beyond it. There the
whole population of the place surrounded them, some
cheering and many others maintaining perfect silence;
but none offered any show of opposition. The peasants
blessed his return; but, on viewing his little band looked
upon him with pity, and entertained no hope of his ultimate
success. The roads were so bad that the pieces of cannon
which they had with them were abandoned in the course
of the day, but they marched full twenty leagues ere they
halted for the night at Seranon. "Before arriving at this
stopping place," says Thiers, "the Emperor stopped a few
minutes in a hut, occupied by an old woman and some cows.
Whilst he warmed himself before a brushwood fire he
entered into conversation with the old country-woman,
who little imagined what guests she entertained beneath
her humble thatch, and was asked, 'What news from
Paris?' She seemed surprised at a question to which
she was little accustomed, and replied very naturally that
she knew of none. 'You don't know what the King is
doing then?' said Napoleon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>"'The King?' answered the old woman, still more
astonished, 'the King! You mean the Emperor&mdash;he is
always <i>yonder</i>.'"</p>

<p>This dweller in the Alpine country was wholly ignorant
that Napoleon had been hurled from his throne and
replaced by Louis XVIII. All present were struck with
astonishment at witnessing this extraordinary ignorance.
Napoleon, who was not less surprised than the others,
looked at Druot and said, "Well, Druot, of what use is
it to disturb the world to fill it with one's name?"</p>

<p>On the 5th of March the Emperor reached Gap, where
he published his first proclamations,&mdash;one to the army
and another to the French people. The former said:
"Soldiers! We have not been conquered. Two men,
raised from our ranks, (Marmont and Augereau) have
betrayed our laurels, their country, their prince, their
benefactor. In my exile I have heard your voice. I
have arrived once more among you, despite all obstacles,
and in all perils. We ought to forget that we have been
the masters of the world; but we ought never to suffer
foreign interference in our affairs. Who dares pretend to
be master over us? Take again the eagles which you
followed at Ulm, at Austerlitz, at Jena, at Eylau, at
Friedland, at Tudela, at Eckmuhl, at Essling, at Smolensk,
at Moskowa, at Lutzen, at Wurtchen, at Montmirail.
Soldiers! come and range yourselves under the banners
of your old chief. Victory shall march at the charging
step. The eagle, with the national colors, shall fly from
steeple to steeple, till it reaches the towers of Notre Dame!
In your old age, surrounded and honored by your fellow-citizens,
you shall be heard with respect when you recount
your high deeds. You shall then say with pride, 'I also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
was one of that great army which entered twice within
the walls of Vienna, which took Rome, and Berlin, and
Madrid and Moscow, and which delivered Paris from the
stain printed on it by domestic treason, and the occupation
of strangers.'"</p>

<p>Between Mure and Vizele, Cambronne, who commanded
Napoleon's advanced guard of forty grenadiers, met
suddenly a battalion sent forward from Grenoble to arrest
the march. The colonel refused to parley with Cambronne
and either party halted until the Emperor came up.
Napoleon did not hesitate for a moment but dismounted
and advanced alone; some paces behind him came about
a hundred of his Guard, with their arms reversed. There
was perfect silence on all sides until the returned Exile
was within a few yards of the men. He then halted, threw
open his surtout, so as to show the star of the Legion of
Honor, and exclaimed, "If there be among you a soldier
who desires to kill his general&mdash;his Emperor&mdash;let him do
it now. Here I am!"</p>

<p>The old cry of "Vive l'Empereur!" burst instantly
from every lip. Napoleon threw himself among them, and
taking a veteran private, covered with scars and medals,
by his beard, said, "Speak honestly, old Moustache,
couldst thou have had the heart to kill thy Emperor?"</p>

<p>The old soldier dropped his ramrod into his piece to
show that it was not loaded, and answered, "Judge if I
could have done thee much harm&mdash;<i>all the rest are the
same</i>!" The soldiers had now broken their ranks and
were surrounding the Emperor, kissing his hands and
calling him their general, their Emperor, their father.
The commander of the 5th battalion, thus abandoned by
his soldiers, knew not what to do, when Napoleon, freeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
himself from the throng stepped forward, asked his name,
his grade, his services and then added: "My friend, who
made you chief of battalion?" "You, Sire," "Who made
you captain?" "You, Sire," "And would you fire on
me?" "Yes" replied the brave man, "in the performance
of my duty." He then gave his sword to Napoleon,
who took it, pressed his hand and in a voice that clearly
indicated that the weapon would be restored at that point,
said, "Meet me at Grenoble." Turning to Bertrand and
Druot the Emperor then said: "All is decided: within ten
days we shall be in the Tuileries!"</p>

<p>Napoleon now gave the word, and the old adherents
and the new began the march together towards Grenoble.
Ere they reached that town Colonel Labedoyere, an
officer of noble family, and who had been promoted by
Louis XVIII., appeared on the road before them at the
head of his regiment, the seventh of the line. These
men and the Emperor's little column, on coming within
view of each other, rushed simultaneously from their
ranks and embraced with mutual shouts of, "Live Napoleon!
Live the Guard! Live the Seventh!"</p>

<p>Labedoyere now produced an eagle, which he had kept
concealed about his person, and broke open a drum which
was found to be filled with tri-colored cockades. As these
ancient ensigns were exhibited by the first officer of
superior rank who voluntarily espoused the side of the
returned Exile, renewed enthusiasm was apparent on all
sides. Napoleon then questioned young Labedoyere
concerning the state of Paris, and France in general.
That gallant officer answered with much frankness: "Sire,
the French will do everything for your Majesty; but your
Majesty must do everything in return for them; no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
ambition, no more despotism; we are determined to be free
and happy. It is necessary, Sire, to renounce that system
of conquest and power which occasioned the misfortune
of France and yourself."</p>

<p>Napoleon replied, "I know that. I return to revive
the glory of France, to establish the principles of the
Revolution and to secure to the nation a degree of liberty
which, though difficult at the commencement of my reign,
is now become not only possible but necessary."</p>

<p>This act of Labedoyere was most decisive, for in spite
of all the efforts of General Marchand, commandant at
Grenoble, the whole of that garrison, when he approached
the walls, shouted "Vive l'Empereur!" Though welcoming
Napoleon with their voices and shaking hands
with his followers through the wicket below, they would
not so far disobey the governor as to throw open the gates.
Neither could any argument prevail upon them to open
fire on the advancing party and in the very teeth of all
their batteries Napoleon calmly planted a howitzer or two
and blew the gates open. Then, as if the spell of discipline
was at once dissolved, the garrison broke from their
lines and dragging the Emperor from his horse, bore him
aloft on their shoulders towards the principal inn of the
place, amidst the clamors of enthusiastic and delirious
joy. The inhabitants of Grenoble, being unable to
bring him the keys of the city, brought him with acclamations,
the shattered gates instead, exclaiming: "For
want of the keys of the good city of Grenoble, here are
the gates for you!" Next morning he reviewed his
troops, now amounting to about 7,000, and on the 9th
recommenced his march.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 10th of March Napoleon came within sight of
Lyons and was informed that Marshal Macdonald had
arrived to take the command, had barricaded the bridge
of Guillotierre, and posted himself at the head of a
large force to dispute the entrance of the town. Nothing
daunted with this intelligence, the column moved on, and
at the bridge of Lyons, as at the gates of Grenoble, all
opposition vanished when the person of the Emperor was
recognized by the soldiery. Macdonald was forced to
retire and Napoleon entered the second city of France in
triumph. Macdonald would have been taken prisoner by
his own troops, had not some of them, more honorable
than the rest, insisted on his escape being unobstructed.
He thereupon returned to Paris where he once more hoped
to make a stand.</p>

<p>A guard of mounted citizens who had been formed to
attend on the person of Count d'Artois, the heir of
the Empire, and who had accompanied Macdonald, were
the foremost to offer their services to the Emperor after he
reached the hotel; but he rejected their assistance and
dismissed them with contempt. Finding that one of their
number had followed the Prince until his person was out
of all danger, Napoleon immediately sent to that individual
the cross of the Legion of Honor.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, during the week that the Emperor had
continued his march Parisward without opposition, the
newspapers of the capital were silent, and none ventured
to make any allusion whatever to his successes. There
then appeared a royal decree, proclaiming Napoleon
Bonaparte "an outlaw," and convoking, on the instant,
the two Chambers. Next day the "Moniteur" announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
that, surrounded on all hands by faithful garrisons and a
loyal population, this "outlaw and invader" was already
stripped of most of his followers, was wandering in despair
among the hills, and certain to be a prisoner within two
or three days at the utmost! Louis received many
addresses full of loyalty and devotion from the public
bodies of Paris, from towns and departments, and, above
all, from the marshals, generals and regiments who happened
to be near the capital. The partisans of Napoleon
at Paris, however, were far more active than the royalists.
They gave out everywhere that, as the proclamation
addressed "To the French people" from Gap had
stated, Napoleon came back thoroughly cured of that
ambition which had armed Europe against his throne;
that he considered his act of abdication void, because the
Bourbons had not accepted the crown on the terms which
it was offered, and had used their authority in a spirit,
and for purposes at variance with the feelings and the
interests of the French people; that he was come to be no
longer the dictator of a military despotism, but the first
citizen of a nation which he had resolved to make the
freest of the free; that the royal government wished to
extinguish by degrees all memory of the Revolution; that
he was returning to consecrate once more the principles
of liberty and equality, ever hateful to the eyes of the old
nobility of France, and to secure the proprietors of forfeited
estates against all machinations of that dominant
faction;&mdash;in a word, that he was fully sensible of the extent
of his past errors, both of domestic administration and of
military ambition, and desirous of nothing but the opportunity
of devoting, to the true welfare of peaceful France,
those unrivalled talents and energies which he had been
rash enough to abuse in former days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>Napoleon's friends declared, too, and with much show of
authority, that the army was, high and low, on the side of
the Emperor; that every detachment sent to intercept
him would but swell his force so that nothing could prevent
him from taking possession of the Tuileries ere a
fortnight more had passed over the head of the Bourbon
King.</p>

<p>Napoleon remained at Lyons from the 10th to the
13th of March. Here he formally resumed the functions of
civil government, published various decrees, one of which
commanded that justice be administered everywhere in his
name after the 15th, another abolishing the Chambers of
the Peers and the Deputies and summoning all the
electoral colleges to meet in Paris to witness the coronation
of Marie Louise and her son, and settle definitively
the constitution of the State; a third, ordering into
banishment all those whose names had not been erased
from the list of emigrants prior to the abdication of
Fontainebleau; a fourth, depriving all strangers and
emigrants of their commissions in the army; a fifth, abolishing
the order of St. Louis, and bestowing all its revenues
on the Legion of Honor; and a sixth restoring to
their authority all magistrates who had been displaced by
the Bourbon government.</p>

<p>These publications soon reached Paris and caused much
alarm among the adherents of the King.</p>

<p>Marshal Ney now received orders from the Minister of
War to take command of a large body of troops whose
fidelity was considered sure, and who were about to be
sent to Lons-le-Saunier, to intercept and arrest the returning
Exile before he could make further progress. Ney
immediately rode to Paris from his retired country-seat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
and there, for the first time, learned of the disembarkation
of Napoleon from Elba. He is even said to have declared
that he would bring his former chief to Paris in a cage,
like a wild beast, in the course of a week. On reaching
Lons-le-Saunier he received a letter from Napoleon
reminding him of their former campaigns and summoning
him to join his standard as the "bravest of the brave."
Ney had a secret interview with a courier who brought
this letter, with one from Bertrand. Generals Lecourbe
and Bourmont, by whom the marshal was attended, advised
him not to oppose a torrent which was too powerful for
any resistance he could bring against it. While in this
state of doubt and indecision, sorely perplexed as to his
exact duty, he received intelligence that his vanguard,
posted at Bourg, had gone over to Napoleon, and that the
inhabitants of Chalons-sur-Saone had seized the park of
artillery. All this confirming what Ney had just been
told by the courier, he exclaimed, "It is impossible for
me to stop the incoming water of the ocean with the palm
of my hand!" Accordingly, on the following morning, he
published an order of the day, declaring that "the cause
of the Bourbons was lost forever, and that the legitimate
dynasty which the French nation had adopted was about
to reascend the throne." This order was read to the
troops and was received by them with rapture; some of
the officers, however, remonstrated and left their command.
One, before he went away, broke his sword in
two, and threw the pieces at Ney's feet, saying, "It is
easier for a man of honor to break iron than to infringe
his word."</p>

<p>Ney put his soldiery in motion forthwith, and joined
the march of the Emperor on the 17th of March at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
Auxerre, being received by Napoleon with open arms.
Ney avowed later that he had chosen the part of Napoleon
long ere he pledged his oath to Louis, adding that the
greater number of the marshals were, like himself,
original members of the Elban conspiracy to again place
him on the throne.</p>

<p>In and about the capital there still remained troops
sufficient in numbers to overwhelm the advancing column,
and Louis intrusted the command of these battalions to
Marshal Macdonald, who proceeded to establish himself
at Melun with the King's army, in the hopes of being supported
by his soldiers in the discharge of his commission.</p>

<p>On the 19th Napoleon slept once more in the chateau
of Fontainebleau, and on the morning of the 20th he
advanced through the forest, alone, and with the full
knowledge of Macdonald's arrangements. About noon
the marshal's troops, who had been for some time under
arms on an eminence beyond the wood, perceived suddenly
a single open carriage coming at full speed towards them
from among the trees. A handful of Polish horsemen,
with their lances reversed, followed the equipage. The
little flat cocked hat; the gray surtout; then the person of
Napoleon was recognized. In an instant the men burst
from their ranks, surrounded him with the cries of "Vive
l'Empereur!" and trampled their white cockades in the
dust. Macdonald escaped to Paris but Louis had not
awaited his last stand. He had set off from the
Tuileries in the middle of the preceding night, amidst
the tears and lamentations of several courtiers, taking the
road to Lisle. McDonald soon overtook and accompanied
him to the frontier of the Netherlands, which he
reached in safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>Napoleon once more entered Paris on the evening of
the 20th of March. He came preceded and followed by
the soldiery on horseback, and on whom alone he had
relied. At the Tuileries he was received with every
possible demonstration of joy and was almost stifled by
the pressure of those enthusiastic adherents who, the
moment he stopped in the court-yard of the palace, mounted
him on their shoulders and carried him in triumph up
the great staircase of the palace. The Emperor, during
this dramatic proceeding, continued to exclaim, "Be steady
my good children; be steady I entreat you." A piece of
his coat being either purposely or by accident torn off, was
instantly divided into hundreds of scraps, for the procurement
of each remnant of which, by way of relic, there
was as much struggling as if the effort had been made to
become possessed of so many ingots of gold. He found
in the apartments, which the King had but lately vacated,
a brilliant assemblage of those who had in former times
filled the most prominent places in his own councils and
court.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Napoleon, as he walked round the
circle, "it is disinterested people who have brought me
back to my capital. It is the subalterns and the soldiers
that have done it all. I owe everything to the people and
the army."</p>

<p>All night long the cannon of Marengo and Austerlitz
pealed forth their joyous sounds, the city was brilliantly
illuminated, and all except the Bourbons, who, as Thiers
happily says, "during twenty-five years had neither
learned or forgotten anything," were rejoicing at the
return of the Exile. Napoleon had now proved that he
was not only Emperor of the army but of the citizens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
the people, the peasantry, and the masses. With a handful
of men he had marched from one end of the kingdom to
the other, entered the capital and taken possession of the
throne, and that without shedding even one drop of blood!</p>

<p>He assigned, among other reasons for leaving Elba, that
in addition to the violation of the treaty of Fontainebleau
in failing to pay his pension, that his wife and child had
been seized, detained, and never permitted to join him; that
the pensions to his mother and brothers were alike refused,
and that assassins had been sent over to Elba, for the
express purpose of murdering him. This last charge has
also been made by Savary with much positiveness. "Last
year," said Napoleon, "it was said that I recalled the
Bourbons; this year they recall me; so we are equal!"</p>

<p>Previous to the morning of the 20th of March the
nights had been rainy and the days sombre and cloudy;
but on this morning, the anniversary of the birth of the
young King of Rome, the day was ushered in by a brilliant
sun and which produced a strong effect on the populace
who again referred in their acclamations to the "sun
of Napoleon" as they had that of Austerlitz, ten years
before. On the following day the whole population of
the capital directed their steps towards the Tuileries and
repeated anon and anon their pleasure at the return of
the Emperor who had, between the 1st and the 20th of
March, fulfilled that strange prophecy in which he said,
victory would march at the charging step, and that the
imperial eagle would fly, without pause, from steeple to
steeple, to the towers of Notre Dame, even to the
dome of the Palace of the Tuileries!</p>

THE HUNDRED DAYS. WATERLOO.</h2>

<p class="p2">The instant that news of Napoleon's daring movement
reached Vienna, the Congress, although on the point of
dissolution, published a proclamation in which it was said:
"By breaking the Convention which had established him
in Elba, Bonaparte destroyed the only legal title on which
his existence depended; and by appearing again in France,
with projects of confusion and disorder, he has deprived
himself of the protection of the laws, and has manifested
to the universe that there can be neither peace or truce
with him. The powers consequently declare, that Napoleon
Bonaparte has placed himself without the pale of
civil and social relations, and that as an enemy and
disturber of the tranquility of the world, he has rendered
himself liable to public vengeance."</p>

<p>All Europe was now prepared once more for war. A
formal treaty was entered into by which the four great
powers, England, Austria, Russia and Prussia, bound
themselves to maintain, each of them, at least 150,000
troops in arms until Napoleon should either be dethroned,
or reduced so low as no longer to endanger the peace of
Europe. The other states of the Continent were to be
invited to join the alliance, furnishing contingents
adequate to their respective resources.</p>

<p>It was stipulated that in case England should not furnish
all the men agreed upon she would compensate by paying
at the rate of $150 per annum for every cavalry soldier,
and $100 for every foot soldier under the full number.</p>

<p>On the day following his return from Elba, Napoleon
reviewed all the troops in Paris, and addressed them in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
of those stirring and eloquent speeches which had
never failed to excite their enthusiasm. In beginning
his address, he said: "Soldiers, I am returned to
France with twelve hundred men, because I relied
upon the love of the people, and the remembrance of
me with the veteran troops. I have not been deceived in
my expectations; I thank you, soldiers. The glory of all
that is achieved is due to the people and yourselves. My
only merit consists in having justly appreciated you."</p>

<p>Cries of "Vive l'Empereur!" filled the air and were
redoubled when General Cambronne entered at the head of
the officers of the battalion of the Guard, which had accompanied
him to and from Elba, and carrying the imperial
eagles. On observing the ancient emblems, Napoleon
exclaimed, "Behold the officers of the battalion who
accompanied me in the hour of misfortune! They are
all my friends; they are dear to my heart; whenever
I beheld them, they presented to my view the different
regiments composing the army; for, in the number of
these six hundred brave men, there are individuals of
every corps. In loving them, it is all of you, soldiers
of the whole army, that I loved. They come to restore
you those eagles; let them prove to you the rallying
point! Swear that they shall be found everywhere,
when the interests of the country shall require them;
that the traitors, and those who would subjugate our
territory, may never be able to support their view."
"We swear!" came the vociferous replies of the soldiers
to the strains of the band playing: "Let us watch over
the safety of the Empire."</p>

<p>Among the peals that rent the air, those of the working
class were particularly audible, their incessant cries being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
couched in these terms: "The Great Contractor is
returned; we shall now eat bread!"</p>

<p>Napoleon was hardly reseated on his throne ere he
learned that he must in all likelihood defend himself against
225,000 Russians, 300,000 Austrians, 236,000 Prussians,
an army of 150,000 men furnished by the minor States of
Germany, 50,000 contributed by the government of the
Netherlands, and 50,000 English, commanded by the Duke
of Wellington; in all 1,100,000 soldiers! From the
moment he re-established himself in the Tuileries, he
began that period of his government, which has been
designated the "Hundred Days," in order to meet this
gigantic confederation. Carnot became once more Minister
of War, and showed the same energy he had manifested
during the Consulate. Napoleon had the nation with
him at that moment, notwithstanding the proclamations
of Louis XVIII.,&mdash;which had found their way into
the capital,&mdash;announced the speedy arrival of a million
foreign soldiers under the walls of Paris to replace him on
his throne and drive away the "usurper."</p>

<p>The Duchess d'Angoulême was the last of the royal
family who remained in France. She had thrown herself
into Bordeaux, trusting to the friendly feeling of the
mayor and citizens. She made strong efforts to maintain
the Bourbon cause, and behaved with so much spirit as
to make Napoleon pass an eulogium on her as "the only
man of her family." But her efforts failed.</p>

<p>The effective force of the army in France, when Napoleon
landed at Cannes, consisted of but about 93,000
men. The cavalry had been greatly reduced, and the
disasters of 1812, 1813 and 1814 were still visible in the
deficiency of military stores, and arms,&mdash;especially of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
artillery. By almost incredible exertions, although now
unable to adopt the old method of conscription, by the
middle of May the Emperor had over 375,000 men in
arms,&mdash;including an Imperial Guard of 40,000 chosen
veterans,&mdash;all in a splendid state of equipment and discipline;
a large and brilliant force of cavalry, and a train of
artillery of proportional extent and excellence. He had
labored unremittingly to raise the military strength of
France to a height sufficient once more to repel the attack
of all Europe, and was employed fifteen or sixteen hours a
day during the whole of this period. Men, clothing, arms,
horses, and discipline were wanting.</p>

<p>All the veterans were now recalled to the ranks. They
came in crowds, leaving the employments to which they
had applied themselves to the number of one hundred
thousand men. All the officers on half pay were also
summoned to action.</p>

<p>Napoleon made several attempts to open a negotiation
with the Allies, and urged three arguments in defense of his
"breach of the Convention" by which he had become
sovereign of Elba: 1st, the detention of his wife and son by
the Court of Austria: 2d, the non-payment of his pension,
and 3d, the voice of the French nation which he had heard
and obeyed, as evidenced by the fact that by the end of
March the tri-colored flag was displayed on every tower in
France.</p>

<p>During the last days of the Congress of Vienna, Murat's
possession of the throne of Naples was under discussion,
and Talleyrand was endeavoring to dethrone him and
place thereon the King of the Sicilies. When Napoleon
landed on the shores of France, Murat resolved to rival his
brother-in-law's daring and without further pause marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
to Rome, at the head of 50,000 men, the Pope and
cardinals fleeing at his approach. Murat then advanced
into the north of Italy, inviting "all true Italians" to rally
round him, and assist in the erection of their country into
one free and independent state, with himself at their head.</p>

<p>The Austrian commander in Lombardy put his troops
in motion at once to meet Murat, and the latter's followers
fleeing in confusion, their leader sought personal safety
in flight. On quitting his wretched remnant of an army he
returned incognito to his capital on the evening of the
18th of May. As he embraced his queen,&mdash;Napoleon's
sister,&mdash;he exclaimed, with emotion, "All is lost, Caroline,
except my own life, and that I have been unable to throw
away!"</p>

<p>He departed in a fishing vessel which landed him near
Toulon about the end of May. Here he lingered for some
time, entreating Napoleon to receive him at Paris, and
being unsuccessful, after a series of extraordinary hardships,
relanded on the coast of Naples after the King of
the Two Sicilies had been re-established on that throne.</p>

<p>Murat hoped to invite an insurrection and recover what
he had lost; but was seized, tried, and executed, meeting
his fate with heroic fortitude. To those who took his life
he said at the last moment, "Save my face; aim at my
heart!" At St. Helena, Napoleon often said that the
fortune of the world might have been changed had there
been a Murat to head the French cavalry at Waterloo.</p>

<p>Austria was now concentrating all her Italian forces for
the meditated re-invasion of France; the Spanish army
began to muster towards the passes of the Pyrenees, the
Russians, Swedes and Danes were already advancing from
the north, while the main armies of Austria, Bavaria and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
the Rhenish princes were rapidly consolidating themselves
along the Upper Rhine. Blucher was once more in
command of the Prussians in the Netherlands; and Wellington,
commanding in chief the British, Hanoverians
and Belgians, had also established his headquarters at
Brussels by the end of May. It was very evident to
Napoleon that the clouds were thickening fast and he at
once began preparations to defend himself ere his frontier
had been crossed on all sides.</p>

<p>Among other preparations, the Emperor had now
strongly fortified Paris and all the positions in advance of
it on the Seine, the Marne, and the Aube, and among the
passes of the Vosgesian hills. Lyons, also, had been
guarded by very formidable outworks. Massena, at Metz,
and Suchet, on the Swiss frontier, commanded divisions
which the Emperor judged sufficient to restrain Schwartzenberg
for some time on the Upper Rhine. Should he
drive them, in the fortresses behind could hardly fail to
detain him much longer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Napoleon had resolved to himself attack the
most alert of his enemies, the Prussians and the English,
beyond the Sambre,&mdash;while the Austrians were thus held
in check on the Upper Rhine; and ere the armies of the
North could debouch upon Manheim, to co-operate by their
right with Wellington and Blucher, and by their left with
Schwartzenberg.</p>

<p>On the 14th of May, previously appointed as the day
of procession and solemn festival of the "Federates,"&mdash;operatives
and artisans of Paris&mdash;the Emperor rode along
their ranks, received their acclamations, and harangued
them in his usual strain of eloquence. In the meantime,
however, Fouché, Minister of Police, had already begun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
to hold traitorous communications with the Austrian
government. In one instance Napoleon had discovered
this fact, and had nearly caused him to be arrested; but he
abstained, apparently from apprehension of the Republican
party, amongst whom Fouché was a busy pretender.</p>

<p>The ceremony of the "Champ-de-Mai" took place on
the 1st of June, in the open space facing the Military School.
The Imperial and National Guards and troops of the
line, amounting in all to 15,000 soldiers, were drawn up in
squares in the Champ-de-Mars and an immense concourse
of spectators thronged every vacant space from which a
view of the scene could be gained. After a religious
solemnity, a patriotic address was delivered to the Emperor
by the electors of the departments, to which he replied:
"Emperor, Consul, Soldier&mdash;I hold all from the people.
In prosperity, in adversity, in the field of battle, in
council, on the throne, in exile, France has been the sole
object of all my thoughts and actions."</p>

<p>The Emperor then proceeded to the altar and took an
oath to observe the new constitution, which had been
adopted by upwards of a million and a half votes, and in
which he was followed by his ministers and the electoral
deputations. The ceremony concluded with the distribution
of the eagles to the troops, and with loud and
repeated acclamations, and cries of "Vive l'Empereur!"
from the soldiers and multitude assembled. On the
following day the Emperor gave a grand fête, in the
gallery of the Louvre, to the deputies of the army and
the electors, on which occasion he was again greeted with
every manifestation of devotion and fidelity. On the 4th
of June, Napoleon attended in person the opening of the
Chambers and delivered addresses which were both firm,
open and sensible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time the Emperor had made most extraordinary
progress in his preparations for war. The effective
strength of the army had been raised to 365,000 men, of
whom 117,000 were under arms, clothed, disciplined and
ready to take the field. They were formed into seven
grand corps, besides several corps of observation stationed
along the whole line of the frontiers, which were then
threatened on every side. What Napoleon now required
was time to prepare the means of defense; but this his
enemies were far from intending to allow.</p>

<p>Their immense armaments were already passing on
towards the frontiers of France, in different lines, and at
considerable intervals, for the convenience of subsistence.
The Emperors of Russia and Austria, and the King of
Prussia, had once more placed themselves at the head of
their respective armies. The Austrians, amounting to
300,000 men, commanded in chief by Schwartzenberg,
were divided into two bodies, one of which was to enter
France by Switzerland, the other by the Upper Rhine.
Two hundred thousand Russians were marching towards
Alsace, under the Archduke Constantine. The Prussian
army amounted to two hundred and thirty-six thousand
men; of whom one half were already in the field. The
minor states of Germany had furnished one hundred and
fifty thousand; the Netherlands, fifty thousand; England,
eighty thousand, including the king's German legion, and
other troops in British pay, under the command of the
Duke of Wellington;&mdash;in all 1,016,000 soldiers!</p>

<p>Among these hosts it was the army commanded by the
Duke of Wellington, and the Prussians under Blucher,
which were first in the field. They occupied Belgium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
and amounted to upwards of two hundred thousand men,
of whom rather less than one half were ranged under the
English commander-in-chief.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Return of Napoleon from Elba</span></div>
</div>

<p>Two plans of campaign presented themselves to the
mind of Napoleon. One was to remain entirely on the
defensive, leaving to the Allies the odium of striking the
first blow against the liberties of nations. He believed
that as they would not begin the invasion until the middle
of July, it would be the middle of August before they
could make their way through the fortresses, and appear
in force before Lyons and Paris. Large armies, could,
before that time, be concentrated by him under the walls
of these two cities, and there the battles must be fought
and decided. The second plan was to assume the offensive
before the Allies had completed their operations, by
marching into Belgium and attacking the armies of
Wellington and Blucher. His numbers would be inferior,
but his tactics would aim at preventing the junction of
the two armies opposed to him and beating them separately,
in which event Belgium would to a certainty rise
and join his cause. He finally resolved on the latter plan
of campaign. His calculations, were, in part, disturbed
by a serious insurrection in La Vendée, which obliged
him to send 20,000 men into that province, in order
to quell it, and reduced his disposable forces to one
hundred and twenty thousand men; but did not alter his
determination. The army was put in motion, and every
preparation made for the approaching struggle.</p>

<p>The Emperor left Paris on the night between the 11th
and 12th of June, as some writers declare "to measure
himself against Wellington." The Imperial Guard had
commenced its march on the 8th, and all the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
corps of the army were in motion towards Maubeuge and
Phillipville. When he had made known his intention of
commencing the war, Caulaincourt solicited the favor of
attending him. "If I do not leave you at Paris" answered
Napoleon, "on whom can I depend?" Even then he
felt that it was not the Allies alone that he had to contend
against; and when he had left Paris he seemed less apprehensive
of the enemies before, than those he had left
behind him. To Bertrand's wife he said, as he took her
hand at departing, "Let us hope, Madame Bertrand, that
we may not soon have to regret the Island of Elba."</p>

<p>Napoleon arrived at Vervins on the 12th of June and
assembled and reviewed at Beaumont on the 14th, the whole
of the army which had been prepared to act immediately
under his own orders. They had been most carefully
selected, and formed, and it was, perhaps, the most perfect
force, though far from the most numerous, with which he
had ever taken the field. The returns showed that his army
amounted to one hundred and twenty-two thousand four
hundred men, with three hundred and fifty pieces of
cannon. These included 25,000 of his Imperial Guard,
25,000 cavalry in the highest condition, and artillery
admirably served. "The whole army was superb and
full of ardor;" says Count Labedoyere, "but the
Emperor, more a slave than could have been credited to
recollections and old habits, committed the great fault of
replacing his army under the command of its former
chiefs, most of whom, notwithstanding their previous
addresses to the King, did not cease to pray for the
triumph of the Imperial cause; yet were not disposed
to serve it with that ardor and devotion demanded by
imperious circumstances. They were no longer men full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
of youth and ambition, generously prodigal of their lives
to acquire rank and fame; but veterans, weary of warfare,
who, having attained the summit of promotion, and being
enriched by the spoils of the enemy, or the bounty of
Napoleon, indulged no other wish, than the peaceable
enjoyment of their good fortune under the shade of those
laurels, they had so dearly acquired."</p>

<p>The Emperor reminded his soldiers, in a fiery proclamation
issued on the 14th of June, that the day was the anniversary
of the battle of Marengo and of Friedland.
"Then, as after Austerlitz and Wagram" he said "we
were too generous. We gave credit to the protestations
and oaths of the princes whom we suffered to remain on
their thrones. Now, however, having coalesced among
themselves, they aim at the independence and the most
sacred rights of France. They have commenced the most
unjust of aggressions. Are we no longer the same men?
Fools that they are! A moment of prosperity blinds
them. The oppression and the humiliation of the French
people are out of their power. If they enter France,
there will they find their tomb. Soldiers! We have forced
marches to make; battles to wage; perils to encounter;
but with constancy the victory will be ours. The rights&mdash;the
honor of the country&mdash;will be honored. For every
Frenchman who has a heart, the moment has now arrived
either to conquer or perish!"</p>

<p>The army of Blucher numbered at this time about
120,000 men. They communicated on their right with the
left of the Anglo-Belgian army, under Wellington, whose
headquarters were at Brussels. Blucher's forces extended
along the line of the Sambre and the Meuse, occupied
Charleroi, Namur, Givet, and Liege. The Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
of Wellington's host amounted in all to 75,000 men; his
first division occupied Enghien, Brain-le-Compte and
Nivelles, communicating with the Prussian right at
Charleroi. The second division,&mdash;Lord Hills',&mdash;was
cantoned in Halle, Oudenard and Gramont, together with
the greater part of the cavalry. The reserve, under Sir
Thomas Picton, was quartered at Brussels and Ghent.
The English and Prussian commanders had thus arranged
their troops with the view of being able to support each
other, wherever the French might hazard their assault.</p>

<p>In the night between the 14th and 15th, scouts returned
to the headquarters of the French, reporting that there
was no movement among the invaders at Charleroi,
Namur or Brussels, thus verifying the Emperor's belief
that the plans for concealing the movements of his army
during the last few days were successful. The Duke of
Wellington, in a letter to Lord Bathurst, on the 13th,
declared his disbelief in the report that Napoleon had
joined the army, and it was not until the afternoon of the
15th that he possessed any knowledge of the position
and intentions of Napoleon. On that day, an officer
of high rank arrived at Wellington's headquarters in
Brussels with the intelligence of Napoleon's decisive
operations.</p>

<p>General Bourmont, a protegé of Ney, with Colonels
Clouet and Villoutreys, and two other officers, had gone
over to the enemy with all the Emperor's plans. Napoleon
knew from Marshal Ney that Bourmont had shown some
hesitation, and he had been backward in employing him.
Bourmont, however, having given General Gerard his
word of honor to serve the Emperor faithfully; and the
general in question, whom Napoleon valued highly, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
answered for his integrity, the Emperor consented to
admit him into the service. He had covered himself with
glory in 1814, and it was not to be expected that he would
in 1815 go over to the enemy on the eve of a battle. A
drum-major, who deserted from the French ranks some
hours before General Bourmont and his two companions,
was conducted under an escort to the headquarters of
Blucher, at Namur, where he gave the first intelligence of
Napoleon's intended attack. This was confirmed by
Bourmont, Clouet and Villoutreys who added details with
which the drum-major could not possibly have been
acquainted.</p>

<p>Later on, in speaking of these traitors, Napoleon said,
"Their names will be held in execration so long as the
French people form a nation. This desertion increased
the anxiety of the soldiers."</p>

<p>The Emperor immediately made those alterations in his
plan of attack, as such unexpected treason rendered
necessary, and then proceeded to carry out the details of
his campaign. He had determined on first attacking the
Prussians, as he believed Blucher would give him battle
at once, in order to allow the English time to collect their
forces. He believed also, that if the English army were
attacked first, Blucher would more rapidly arrive to the
support of the English than the latter were likely to do
if the Prussians were first attacked.</p>

<p>Ney had been placed in command of 43,000 men, with
orders to advance on the road to Brussels and make himself
master of the position of Quatre-Bras, at all points,
so as to prevent Wellington from supporting the Prussians.
He was to march at daybreak, on the 16th, occupy the
position and intrench himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span></p>

<p>On Thursday, the 15th of June, the French drove in all
the outposts on the west bank of the Sambre at daybreak
and at length assaulted Charleroi, it being the intention of
the Emperor to crush Blucher ere he could concentrate
all his own forces,&mdash;far less be supported by the advance
of Wellington,&mdash;and then rush on Brussels. Zietten held
out with severe loss at Charleroi; but long enough for
the alarm to spread along the whole Prussian line and
then fell back on a position between Ligny and Amand,
where Blucher now awaited Napoleon's attack at the
head of his whole army, except the division of Bulow,
which had not yet come up from Liege.</p>

<p>The design of beating the Prussians in detail was not a
success but the second part of the plan&mdash;that of separating
them wholly from Wellington, might still succeed. With
this view, while Blucher was concentrating his force
about Ligny, the French held the main road to Brussels
from Charleroi, beating some Nassau troops at Frasnes,
and following them as far as Quatre-Bras, a farm-house,
so-called because it is there that the roads from Charleroi
to Brussels, and from Nivelles to Namur cross each other.</p>

<p>On Thursday a Prussian officer arrived at Wellington's
headquarters in Brussels, with the intelligence of Napoleon's
decisive operations. It is still an open question
just what hour this news was received by the Duke, the
time being variously stated at from 1 to 6 o'clock p.m.
This news was to the effect that the attack had commenced
and the outposts of the Allies had been driven back&mdash;much
to Wellington's surprise, as he was not wholly prepared for
the news. There was to be a ball in Brussels on Thursday
evening, at the Duchess of Richmond's hotel, attended by
the Duke of Wellington and most of his general
officers. Notwithstanding the intelligence, they all went;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
but a second dispatch arrived at 11 o'clock, announcing
that "the French had entered Charleroi that morning,
and continued to march in order of battle on Brussels;
that there were one hundred and fifty thousand strong;
and that the Emperor was at their head!" It was now
but too clear that no more time should be lost and the
Duke and all of his officers hurried out of the ball-room.</p>

<p>Wellington, now fully aware of his situation, at once
issued orders for the breaking up of his cantonments, and
the concentration of the forces, which were spread over a
very great extent. He rode off at an early hour on the
16th, to Quatre-Bras, to visit the position, and thence to
Bry, where he had an interview with Blucher.</p>

<p>Napoleon, whose manoeuvres had thus far succeeded to
his wish, on coming up from Charleroi about noon on the
16th, was undecided whether Blucher at Ligny, or
Wellington at Quatre-Bras, ought to form the main object
of his attack. He at length determined to give his own
personal attention to Blucher.</p>

<p>The advanced guards met at the village of Fleurus,
and those belonging to the Prussians having retreated,
their army now appeared drawn up in battle array;&mdash;their
left on Sombref; their centre on Ligny; their right on
St. Amand. The reserves were on the heights of Bry.
Upon the summit of this high ground the mill of Bry was
conspicuous, and behind the mill, in a depression, stood
the village of Bry, whose steeple only was visible.</p>

<p>The Prussian forces occupied a line nearly four miles
in extent. The French army, not including Ney's division,
amounting to 60,000 men, halted and formed. The
Emperor now rode to some windmills on the chain of
outposts on the heights, and reconnoitred the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prussians displayed to him a force of about 80,000
men. Their front was protected by a deep ravine; but their
right was exposed, and had Ney's division at Quatre-Bras,
as the Emperor supposed, in the rear. A staff officer now
arrived from Ney, to inform Napoleon that he had not
yet occupied Quatre-Bras, in consequence of reports which
made him apprehensive of being turned by the enemy;
but that he would advance, if the Emperor still required
it. Napoleon blamed him for having lost eight hours,
repeated the order, and added that, as soon as Ney had
made good that position, he (Ney) was to send a detachment
by the causeway of Namur and the village of
Marchais, whence it should attack the heights of Bry in
the Prussian rear. Ney received this order at 12 o'clock,
noon; his detachment might reach Marchais by about
2 o'clock.</p>

<p>At this latter hour, therefore, the Emperor having descended
from the heights whence he had formed a correct view of
his position, gave orders for an immediate attack by a
change of the whole front, divided into several columns, on
Fleurus. The attack extended all along the line of the
enemy, and which would be enclosed between two fires on
the arrival of the detachment from Ney's division in the
rear of the Prussians. "The fate of the war," said Napoleon,
in answer to a question from Count Gérard, "may be
decided in three hours. If Ney executes his orders well,
not a gun of the Prussian army will escape." The
soldiers had hardly advanced a few paces, amid vociferous
cries of "Vive l'Empereur!" when terrible ravages
were made in their ranks by the chain-shot from the
village and the balls from the batteries above. A single
ball killed eight men in one of the columns. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
enthusiasm of the troops, all eager for battle, was too great
to cause them to waver and they advanced almost without
firing, drove the Prussians at the point of the bayonet
from their positions in the gardens and orchards, and
entered the village after a stout resistance, only to retire a
short time later being unable to conquer the masses of
infantry drawn up in a semi-circle on a slope which
surmounted the hill of Bry. The action at Ligny had
commenced a little later but not less aggressively. As
Gérard's three columns approached the village of Ligny
they were received with such a volley that they were
obliged to fall back. A large body of artillery was then
thrown forward and riddled the village of Ligny and
Gérard's columns again advanced, finally taking possession
of the place. This was followed by a series of
combats, exceedingly ferocious, as the French gave no
quarter nor did they receive any from the Prussians.</p>

<p>Blucher now advanced at the head of his soldiers and
made a vigorous attempt upon the three St. Amands; but
with only partial success for a time. At length, by a
series of skillful attacks and manoeuvres, the French
became masters of these three points, but had not been
able to cross the sinuous stream of Ligny. It was now
5:30 o'clock and Napoleon was directing the Imperial
Guard upon Ligny in support of the advantages already
gained by Count Gérard at the head of 5,000 men, at
St. Amand, when he was informed that an army of 30,000
was advancing upon Fleurus. The Emperor suspended
the movement of his Guard in order to meet this new
force; but the alarm was unfounded. It proved to be
the first corps,&mdash;Count d'Erlon's,&mdash;which formed part of
Ney's division, at last complying with Napoleon's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
repeated orders, and had come up to take the enemy in the
rear:&mdash;their unexpected appearance had occasioned the
loss of two hours.</p>

<p>The Old Guard now resumed its suspended movements
upon Ligny: the ravine was passed by General Pecheux,
at the head of his division, supported by the infantry,
cavalry, artillery and Milhaud's cuirassiers. The reserves
of the Prussians were driven back with the bayonet, and
the centre of the line broken and routed. A bloody
conflict ensued in which the French were victorious. The
slaughter among the Prussians, was most remarkable.
They, however, divided into two parts, effected a retreat,
favored by the night and by the failure of that attack in
the rear which Ney had been so expressly ordered to
make by a detachment from his force. Their loss amounted
to the prodigious number of 18,000 men, killed, wounded
or prisoners; forty pieces of cannon and eight stands of
colors, while the French loss was between 8,000 and
9,000.</p>

<p>For five hours, two hundred pieces of ordnance deluged
the field with slaughter, blood and death, during which
period the French and Prussians, alternately vanquished
and victors, disputed that ensanguined post hand to hand
and foot to foot, so that no less than seven times in
succession Ligny was taken and lost.</p>

<p>The Emperor had repeatedly sent to Ney saying "that
the destiny of France rested in his hands" but the veteran
marshal failed to appreciate the importance of the orders
and did not act promptly.</p>

<p>Many of the Prussian generals were killed or wounded;
and Blucher himself was overthrown, man and horse, by
a charge of cuirassiers, and galloped over by friends and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
foes. Night was coming on and the marshal, who was
much battered and bruised, effected his escape. He joined
a body of his troops, directed the retreat upon Wavres,
and continued to mask his movements so skilfully, that
Napoleon knew not until noon on the 17th what way he
had taken.</p>

<p>The total loss of the French amounted to no more than
nine thousand, killed or wounded&mdash;the extraordinary
disproportion being occasioned by the more skillful disposition
of the French troops, whereby all their shots took
effect, while more than half of those of the enemy were
wasted.</p>

<p>On the same day as the battle of Ligny,&mdash;June 16th,&mdash;was
also fought the battle of Quatre-Bras, and at about
the same time. Ney, with 45,000 men, began an attack
on the position of Wellington at Quatre-Bras. At this
point the French were posted among growing corn as high
as the tallest man's shoulder, and which enabled them to
draw up a strong body of cuirassiers close to the English,
and yet entirely out of their view. The 49th and 42d
regiments of Highlanders were thus taken by surprise, and
the latter would have been destroyed but for the coming
up of the former. The 42d, formed into a square, was
repeatedly broken, and as often recovered, though with
terrible loss of life, for out of 800 that went into action,
only ninety-six privates and four officers remained unhurt.</p>

<p>The pressing orders of Napoleon not allowing the
marshal time for reflection, and doubtless anxious to repair
the precious time lost in which he might have taken possession
of Quatre-Bras, he did not sufficiently reconnoitre
but entered into the contest without being wholly prepared.
The first successful attack was soon suspended by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
arrival of fresh reinforcements, led by the Duke of Wellington,
and the shining bravery of the Scotch, Belgians and
the Prince of Orange suspended the success of the French.
They were repulsed by a shower of bullets from the
British infantry added to a battery of two guns which
strewed the causeway with men and horses.</p>

<p>Ney was desirous of making the first corps, which
he had left in the rear, advance; but Napoleon had
dispatched positive orders to Count d'Erlon, at the head
of that body, to join him, for which purpose the latter
had commenced his march. Ney, when made acquainted
with this fact, was stationed amidst a cross-fire from the
enemies' batteries. "Do you see those bullets?" cried the
marshal, his brow clouded by despair; "would that they
would all pass through my body!" and he instantly sent
General Delcambre with all speed after Count d'Erlon,
directing that whatsoever might have been his orders,
although received from the Emperor himself, he must
return. This he did, but when he arrived in the evening,
Ney, dispirited by the checks already received, and
dissatisfied with himself and others, had discontinued
the engagement. D'Erlon had spent the day in useless
marches, his valor wasted by a fatality over which he had
no control. Between 5 and 6 o'clock General Delcambre
had overtaken the first corps on its march to Bry and
brought it back towards Quatre-Bras!</p>

<p>Night found the English, after a severe and bloody day,
in possession of Quatre-Bras, the French being obliged to
retreat. The gallant Duke of Brunswick, fighting in front
of the line, fell almost in the beginning of the battle.
The killed and wounded on the side of the French was
4,000 and the Allies' loss was nearly 6,000, in consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
of their having scarcely any artillery. As at Ligny, little
quarter was either asked or given, there being much hatred
between the French and Prussians. The French were next
driven out from the Bois de Bossu by the Belgians, and the
English divisions of Alten, Halket, Maitland, Cooke, and
Byng, successively arrived.</p>

<p>By neglecting to move the whole of his division
upon Quatre-Bras early in the morning, Ney failed to cut
off the means of junction between the Prussian and English
armies; and by not sending the detachment to attack the
Prussians in the rear at Ligny, it now appears that the
whole Prussian army was saved from being destroyed, or
made prisoners, before it could receive the full support
which had been promised by the Duke of Wellington.
The latter intended to advance on Quatre-Bras at 2 o'clock,
and debouch on St. Amand at 4 p. m. Ney, however,
did an important act in checking the advance of five or six
divisions of the main army during the rest of the day while
the battle of Ligny was decided, and in this repaired, in a
measure, his various faults committed on the 16th.</p>

<p>The French bivouacked, on the night of the 16th, on
the battlefield of Ligny, with the exception of Grouchy's
division, which encamped at Sombref. The Duke of
Wellington passed the night at Quatre-Bras,&mdash;his army
gradually joining him till the morning of the 17th,&mdash;when
they amounted to 50,000 men. The victory
acquired by Napoleon at Ligny did not fulfill his expectations.
"If Marshal Ney had attacked the British
with his united forces," said the Emperor, "they must
inevitably have been crushed; after which, he might have
given the Prussians a conclusive blow; but, even if after
neglecting that first step he had not committed a second,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
in impeding the movement of Count d' Erlon, the appearance
of the first corps would have curtailed Blucher's
resistance, and secured his overthrow without a possibility
of doubt; then his entire army must have been captured
or annihilated."</p>

<p>Ney was now ordered to advance on Quatre-Bras at
daybreak, and attack the British rear-guard, while Count
Lobau was to proceed along the causeway of Namur, and
take the British in flank. General Pajol, at daybreak,
also went in pursuit of the Prussians under Blucher. He
was supported by Grouchy, with Excelmans' cavalry,
and the third and fourth corps of infantry, amounting in
all to about 32,000 men. Grouchy was ordered by the
Emperor to "above all things, pursue the Prussians
briskly, and keep up a communication with me to the
left" so as to rejoin the main army whenever required.</p>

<p>Napoleon rode over the field of battle at Ligny, and
directed every assistance be given to the wounded. He
then hurried to the support of Ney's attack on Quatre-Bras.
He learned that it was still held by the British, and
that Ney had not made the attack. He reproached Ney
on meeting him, and the marshal excused his delay by
declaring he believed the whole British army was there.
This, however, was not the case.</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington, who intended a junction with
the Prussians at Quatre-Bras,&mdash;but had been frustrated by
their disastrous defeat at Ligny,&mdash;now ordered a retreat
on Brussels, leaving the Earl of Uxbridge, with his
cavalry, as a rear-guard. Napoleon directed Count
Lobau's division to advance, and the British cavalry then
began to retire in battle-array. The French army moved
forward in pursuit, the Emperor leading the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<p>The weather was extremely bad, the rain falling in
torrents, so that the roads were scarcely passable. The
attack of cavalry on the British rear-guard was, therefore,
impracticable, but they were much discomfited by the
French artillery. About 6 o'clock the air became
extremely foggy, so that all further attack was relinquished
for the night; but not until the Emperor had ascertained
that the whole English army was encamped on the field
of Waterloo, in front of the forest of Soignies.</p>

<p>Napoleon, having ascertained the retreat of Blucher on
Wavres, and committed the pursuit of him to Marshal
Grouchy, believed that the latter was close to the same
place,&mdash;as he ought to have been; but was not. At 10
o'clock on the night of the 17th the Emperor dispatched
an officer to Wavres, to inform Grouchy that there would
be a great battle next day; that the English and Belgian
armies were posted on the field of Waterloo, its left
supported by the village of La Haye; and ordered him to
detach seven thousand men, of all arms, and six pieces of
cannon, before day break to St. Lambert, to be near to the
right of the French army, and co-operate with it; that as
soon as Blucher evacuated Wavres, either towards Brussels,
or in any other direction, he should instantly march with
the rest of his force, and support the detachment sent to
St. Lambert. About an hour after this dispatch was
sent off, the Emperor received a report from Grouchy,
dated from Gembloux at 5 o'clock, stating that "he was
still at this village, and had not learned what direction
Blucher had taken!"</p>

<p>At 4 o'clock in the morning a second officer was sent to
Grouchy to repeat the communication, and the orders
which had been sent to Wavres at 10 o'clock. Another
dispatch soon after arrived from Grouchy,&mdash;who had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
at that time been found by either of the officers sent by the
Emperor, to state that, "he had learned that Blucher was
in Wavres, and would follow him&mdash;in the morning!"</p>

<p>The Emperor was now convinced that he had not an
hour to spare. He saw the possibility of the Duke's
retreat with Blucher through the forest, their subsequent
junction, while the great armies of Russia and Austria
were about to cross the Rhine and advance on
Paris. He now regretted more than ever that he had been
unable to attack the English army before the night had
intervened, and determined to follow and attack it now, if
it commenced a retreat.</p>

<p>It was not until 6 o'clock on the 17th of June that the
advance guard of the French army arrived on the plains
of Waterloo,&mdash;a delay being occasioned by unfortunate
occurrences upon the road,&mdash;otherwise the forces would
have gained the spot by 3 o'clock in the day. The circumstance
appeared to disconcert the Emperor extremely,
who, pointing to the sun, exclaimed with much emphasis,
"What would I not give, to be this day possessed
of the power of Joshua, and enabled to retard thy march
for two hours!"</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington, on being made aware of
Blucher's march on Wavre, and in adherence to the
common plan of campaign, had given orders for falling
back from Quatre-Bras. He had before now been heard
to say, that if it ever were his business to defend Brussels,
he would choose to give battle on the field of Waterloo,
in advance of the forest of Soignies; and he now retired
thither, in the confidence of being joined there in the morning
by Blucher. The English at last reached the destined
field, over roads covered with deep mud, and in the face of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
considerable rain. The troops, although somewhat
discouraged by the command to retreat, were enthusiastic
when they heard of their leader's purpose, and having
taken up their allotted stations, bivouacked for the night
assured of a battle on the morrow&mdash;the 18th of June.</p>

</div>

<p>Arrangements having been effected early in the evening,
Wellington now, it appears, according to Lockhart,
although the statement is not fully substantiated, rode
across the country to Blucher to inform him personally
that he had thus far effected the plan agreed on, and to
express his hope to be supported on the morrow by two
Prussian divisions. Blucher replied that he would reserve
a single corps to hold Grouchy at bay as well as they
could, and march himself, with the rest of his army upon
Waterloo. Wellington then returned to his post.</p>

<p>The cross-roads at Mont St. Jean were in an almost
impassable condition and the rain continued to fall in
torrents. Wellington was before the village of Mont
St. Jean, about a mile and a half in advance of the small
town of Waterloo, on a rising ground, having a gentle
and regular declivity before it,&mdash;beyond this a plain of
about a mile in breadth,&mdash;and then the opposite heights
of La Belle Alliance, on which the French were expected
to form their line. The Duke had 76,700 men in all; of
whom about 30,000 were English. He formed his first
line of the troops on which he could most surely rely,&mdash;the
greater part of the British infantry, with the troops of
Brunswick and Nassau, and three corps of Hanoverians
and Belgians. Behind this the ground sinks and then
rises again. The second line, formed in the rear of the
first, was composed of the troops whose spirit and discipline
were more doubtful&mdash;or who had suffered most in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
action at Quatre-Bras; and behind all these was placed
the cavalry. The position crossed the two highways
from Nivelles and Charleroi to Brussels, nearly where they
unite. These roads gave every facility for movement from
front to rear during the action; and two country roads
running behind, and parallel with the first and second lines,
favored movements from wing to wing. The chateau and
gardens of Hougomont, and the farm-house and inclosures
of La Haye Sainte, about 1,500 yards apart, on the slope
of the declivity, were strongly occupied and formed the
important out-works of defense. The opening of the
country road leading directly from Wavre to Mont St. Jean,
through the wood of Ohain, was guarded by the British
left, while those running further in advance might be
expected to bring the first of the Prussians on the
right flank of the French, during their expected attack.
The British front extended in all over about a mile, with
the strong outposts of Hougomont (situated near the
centre of the right) and La Haye (which was in front of
the centre) and in the rear the village of Mont St. Jean
with the reserve force stationed there,&mdash;further back, the
town of Waterloo (which has given its name to the battle
because it was thence that the English general dated his
dispatches)&mdash;and the forest of Soignies, as positions to
retire upon, to make a stand or cover a retreat. A more
advantageous ground for receiving an attack could not
easily be obtained in any open country, not previously
fortified. It was, therefore, sufficiently evident that the
Duke of Wellington had availed himself of all these means
of defense, by a circumspect and masterly disposition of
his forces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Wellington's design to hold Napoleon at bay
until the Prussian advance should enable him to charge
the French with superior numbers, while it was Napoleon's
wish to beat the Anglo-Belgian army, or at least to divide
it, as well as to cut off its communications, ere Blucher
could arrive on the field.</p>

<p>Napoleon hoped to turn the left wing of the Duke's
army, it being the weakest, and divide it from the right
wing because he should thus intercept its junction with
the Prussians by the road from Wavre,&mdash;and because he
was in constant expectation of being joined himself by
Grouchy from that side. Having effected this separation
of the wings, and made a vigorous attack on both wings
to distract the attention, it was his design to fall suddenly
on the centre, break it, and rout all its component parts
in detail. The Duke considered it his business to defeat,
if possible, all these attempts; not to venture a general
attack in return, but to hold his defensive position in the
most cautious and determined manner until the arrival of
Blucher.</p>

<p>The Emperor had in the field 72,000 men, all French
veterans&mdash;each of whom was, as he declared, worth one
Englishman and two Prussians, Dutch or Belgians. Napoleon's
forces, however, unlike those of Wellington's, had
been on the march all through the tempestuous darkness,
many of them had not had sufficient food, and the greater
part of them did not reach the heights of La Belle Alliance
until the morning of the 18th was considerably advanced.
The Duke's followers had by that time had refreshment
and some hours of repose.</p>

<p>At 1 o'clock in the morning, the Emperor having
issued the necessary orders for the battle during the earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
part of the night, went out on foot, accompanied by his
grand marshal, and visited the whole line of the main
guards. The forest of Soignies, occupied by the British,
appeared as one continued blaze, while the horizon between
that spot and the farms of La Belle Alliance and La Haye
Sainte, was brightened by the fires of numerous
bivouacs; the most profound silence reigning. Some time
later the rain began to fall in torrents. Napoleon feared
more than anything else that Wellington would continue
his retreat on Brussels and Antwerp,&mdash;thus deferring the
great battle until the Russians should approach the valley
of the Rhine. The night of June 17-18, often called the
"Vigil of Waterloo" was solemn, dark and without
unusual incident during the early hours. Several officers
sent to reconnoitre, and others who returned to headquarters
at half-past three, announced that the British had
made no movement. At 4 o'clock the scouts brought in
a peasant, who had served as a guide to a brigade of
English cavalry which had proceeded to secure a position
on the left at the village of Ohain. Two Belgian deserters,
who had just quitted their regiments, also reported that
their army was preparing for a battle; and that no
retrograde movement had taken place; that Belgium
prayed for the success of the Emperor, as the English and
Prussians were alike unpopular.</p>

<p>The French troops bivouacked amidst deep mud and
the officers thought it impossible to give battle on the
following day; the ground being so moistened that
artillery and cavalry could not possibly manoeuvre, while
it would require twelve hours of fine weather to dry the
soil. On reaching the eminence of La Belle Alliance at
sunrise, and beholding the enemy drawn up on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
opposite side and in battle array, the Emperor exclaimed,
with evident joy, "At last! at last, then, I have these
English in my grasp!" And yet, at this time, his exertions
had been most phenomenal, and he was far from
being in the physical condition necessary for such a contest
as he had every reason to expect. He had been eighteen
hours in the saddle on June 15th, and had slept but three
hours before the battle of Ligny. On the 16th he was
again for eighteen hours on horseback. On the 17th he
rose at five in the morning and that night was almost continually
astir.</p>

<p>The Emperor's breakfast was served at 8 o'clock and
many officers of distinction were present. "The enemy's
army" said Napoleon, "is superior to ours by nearly a
fourth; there are, nevertheless, ninety chances in our
favor, to ten against us." The Emperor now mounted his
horse, and rode forward to reconnoitre the English lines;
after which he remained thoughtful for a few moments,
and then dictated the order of battle. It was written
down by two generals seated on the ground, after which
two aides-de-camp promptly distributed it among the
different corps. The army moved forward in eleven
columns, and as they descended from the heights of La
Belle Alliance the trumpets played "To the Field!" and
the bands alternately struck up airs which recalled the
memories of many victories.</p>

<p>The French line of battle was formed in front of
Planchenois, having the heights of La Belle Alliance in the
rear of its centre. The forces were drawn up in six lines,
on each side of the causeway of Charleroi. The first and
second lines were of infantry, having the light cavalry
at each of its wings, so as to unite them with the six lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
of the main force. The artillery was placed in the
intervals between the brigades. All the troops were in
their stations by about 10:30 o'clock.</p>

<p>Amidst this mass of men there was an almost painful
silence until the Emperor rode through the ranks when
he was received with the utmost enthusiasm; then, giving
his last orders, he galloped to the heights of Rossome,
which commanded a complete view of both armies below,
with a considerable range on each side beyond.</p>

<p>While Napoleon's design for making his grand attack
from the centre, on La Haye Sainte,&mdash;which was directly
in front of the enemy's centre,&mdash;was preparing, he gave
orders for the commencement of the battle.</p>

<p>The grand attack on the centre of the Anglo-Belgian
army was to be made by Marshal Ney. The marshal had
sent word to Napoleon that everything was ready, and he
only awaited the order to begin. Before giving it Napoleon
looked over the field of battle and the surrounding
country,&mdash;the last he was ever to contest. He then perceived
a dark mass at a distance in the direction of St. Lambert,
where he had ordered Grouchy to send a detachment. The
glasses of all the officers were instantly turned towards the
object. Some thought it only a mass of dark trees. To
remove all doubts the Emperor dispatched General Daumont,
with a body of three thousand light cavalry, to form a
junction with them if they were the troops of Grouchy, or
to keep them in check if they were hostile. Through a
Prussian hussar, who was brought in a prisoner, it was
learned that the dark mass was the advanced guard of
Bulow, who was coming up with thirty thousand fresh men;
that Blucher was at Wavres with his army, and that
Grouchy had not appeared there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p>

<p>A messenger was immediately dispatched to Marshal
Grouchy, to march on St. Lambert, without a moment's
delay, and take Bulow's division in the rear. It was
believed that Grouchy must be near at hand, whether he
had received the various orders sent him or not, as he
himself had sent word that he should leave Gembloux in
the morning, and from this place to Wavres was only
three leagues distance.</p>

<p>Napoleon had a high opinion of Grouchy and his
punctuality, he being an officer of great experience; but
the Emperor was in a state of great suspense on account
of his failure to hear from him. He now ordered Count
Lobau to follow and support the cavalry of Daumont, and
to take up a strong position, where, with ten thousand
men, he might keep thirty thousand in check; also to
redouble the attack directly he found that Grouchy had
arrived on the rear of the Prussians. Napoleon thus early
found himself deprived of the services of ten thousand
men on this grand field of battle. These events caused
some change in his first plans, being deprived of the
men whom he was thus obliged to send against General
Bulow.</p>

<p>"We had ninety chances for us in the morning," said
Napoleon to Soult; "but the arrival of Bulow reduces
them to thirty; we have still, however, sixty against
forty; and if Grouchy repairs the horrible fault he has
committed by amusing himself at Gembloux, victory will
therefore be more decisive for the corps of Bulow must
in that case be entirely lost."</p>

<p>It was now 11:30 o'clock and the Emperor at once
turned his attention to the main attack and sent word to
Ney to begin his movement. Instantly one hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
twenty pieces of artillery were unmasked. Then the
French opened their fire of musketry on the advanced
post of Hougomont and Jerome Bonaparte, under cover
of its fire, charged impetuously on the Nassau troops in
the wood about the house. They were driven before the
French, but a party of English guards instantly unmasked
forty pieces of cannon and maintained themselves in the
chateau and garden, despite the desperate character of
many repeated assaults. Jerome, masking the post thus
resolutely held, pushed on his cavalry and artillery against
Wellington's right. The English formed in squares to
receive them and defied all their efforts. For some time
both parties opposed each other here, without either
gaining or losing a foot of ground. At length the
English forced back the French, and the garrison of
Hougomont was relieved and strengthened. There was
great loss on the side of the British, owing to the suddenness
of the attack, and the fixed position and dense array
of the squares. The loss of the French was also considerable;
and as the squares remained unbroken, no
apparent advantage was gained by the assault.</p>

<p>The French, being again repelled, a communication was
reopened with Hougomont and the small body of English
guards, defending the chateau, received a reinforcement
under Colonel Hepburn. The garrison of Hougomont
now made a combined charge; and, after a furious
struggle, in which the utmost valor, both individual and
collective was displayed on either side, drove back the
French once more out of the wood, and recovered the
position. The French in their turn rallied,&mdash;returned
with renewed vigor,&mdash;and the English were now dislodged
and driven out with great slaughter. They rallied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
in turn and immediately returned, and again they recovered
the position. The French charged again but the martial
spirit of the English guards was now wrought up to the
highest pitch, and all the attempts of the assailants to dislodge
them proved unavailing. This contest lasted
through the greater part of the day. The killed and
wounded on both sides during the struggle for this single
outpost has been estimated at upwards of four thousand.</p>

<p>The Emperor, calmly observing the whole from the
heights, praised the valor of the English guards highly.
He now ordered Hougomont to be attacked by a battery of
howitzers and shells. The roofs and barns then took fire,
and the remnant of the English guards remaining were
obliged to retreat before the flames, over the mingled heaps
of dead and dying bodies of their comrades and assailants.</p>

<p>The first onslaught of the French made a series of
dreadful gaps along the whole of the enemy's left and one
of its divisions was completely swept away. The gaps were
quickly filled by fresh men, however, as a column of French
began to advance. Before it could be supported a grand
charge of English cavalry was made, which broke the
column of French infantry, routed it, and took two
eagles and several pieces of cannon. While the English
were wheeling off triumphantly, they were met by a
brigade of Milhaud's cuirassiers. A desperate conflict
ensued at sword's length, the combat lasting much beyond
the usual time, the result of a meeting of two bodies of
cavalry being generally determined in a few minutes.
A quartermaster of the lancers, named Urban, rushed into
the thickest of the fight, and took prisoner the brave
Ponsonby, commander of the 1,200 Scotch dragoons,&mdash;called
the "Scotch Greys," from the color of their horses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
The Scotch sought to free their general but Urban struck
him dead at his feet; he was then attacked by several
dragoons, but instantly rushing at the holder of the
standard of the 45th he unhorsed him with a blow of his
lance, killed him with a second, seized the colors, killed
another of the Scotch who pursued him close, and then,
covered with blood, returned to his colonel with the trophy
which had but a short time before been captured from
Marcognet's division.</p>

<p>Desperate charges of infantry and cavalry now followed
in rapid succession, the immediate object of the French
being the occupation of the outpost of the Anglo-Belgian
army at the farm of La Haye Sainte, and thence to push
on to the farm of Mont St. Jean. Some of the Scotch
regiments made a gallant defense, but were overpowered;
the 5th and 6th English divisions were nearly destroyed,
and General Picton, who commanded the English left, was
laid dead on the field.</p>

<p>The French eventually carried La Haye Sainte; a
body of their infantry pushed forward beyond the farm,
and overwhelmed and scattered several regiments; but
were charged in their turn by two brigades of English
foot and heavy cavalry and routed. In consequence of
this the farm of La Haye Sainte was vigorously assaulted
by the English; and with the assistance of cannon and
shells, was recovered.</p>

<p>This important post was taken and retaken several
times, with an energy that never relaxed on either side.
An error in tactics, of which Ney and d'Erlon had been
guilty, had left four or five columns of French infantry at
the mercy of the enemy's cavalry, and cost them 3,000
men in dead, wounded and prisoners. The English had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
lost part of their dragoons, part of Kempt and Pack's cavalry,
and Generals Picton and Ponsonby,&mdash;all amounting
to about the same number as the French had lost; but the
English had maintained their position and the whole
operation was to be recommenced under the disadvantage
of having foiled in the first attempt.</p>

<p>The French were still masters of a part of La Haye
Sainte farm and were rallying again on the side of the
valley which lay between them and the English. Napoleon
joined them, and walked in front of their ranks midst
bullets rebounding from one line to another, and howitzers
resounding in the air, General Desvaux, commander of
the artillery of the Guard being killed at his side.</p>

<p>During these assaults on the centre of the British line,
the French cuirassiers had advanced to the charge in the
face of a terrific fire from the artillery in front of the
British infantry. The infantry awaited it, formed in a
double line of squares, placed checkerwise, so that the
sides of each square could fire a volley on the advancing
cavalry, and protected in front by a battery of thirty field-pieces.
The French cuirassiers rode up to the very
mouths of the cannon, charged the artillerymen, drove
them from their guns, and then rode fiercely on the squares
behind. These remained steadfast, withholding their fire
until the French were within a few yards of their bayonets,
and then opened on them with deadly effect. The cavalry
was all but broken, then rallied and renewed their charge.
This they did several times, and always with the same result.
Sometimes they even rode between the squares, and
charged those of the second line. As the cuirassiers
retired the artillerymen rushed from behind the squares,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
formed four deep, manned their guns, and fired grape-shot
with terrible effect on the retreating body of gallant but
ineffective cavalry.</p>

<p>At length protracted exposure to such a murderous fire
completed the ruin of these fearless cavaliers, the far
greater part being annihilated in this part of the battle.</p>

<p>When the relics of the cuirassiers at last withdrew, the
French cannonade opened up furiously once more all along
the line. It was vigorously returned, but the effect was far
more devastating amidst the British ranks than in those
of their assailants. The English were then commanded
by Wellington to lie flat on the ground for some space, in
order to diminish its effects. The Duke had by this time
lost 10,000 men and Napoleon possibly a few more.</p>

<p>It was now 4 o'clock and about this time the Emperor
received intelligence from Gembloux, that, notwithstanding
his repeated orders, Marshal Grouchy had not left
his encampment at that place till after 10 o'clock in the
morning, in consequence, it was said, of the state of the
weather. The body of ten thousand men, under Count
Lobau and General Daumont, were now in action with the
Prussians under Bulow, near St. Lambeth. The cannonade
continued for considerable time; the Prussian
centre was then attacked and beaten back, but its wings
advancing, Count Lobau was obliged to retire.</p>

<p>At this crisis Napoleon dispatched General Dufresne,
with two brigades of infantry of the young guard, and
twenty-four pieces of cannon, and the Prussian advance
was checked. They still endeavored to out-flank the
French right, when several battalions of the Old Guard,
with sixteen pieces of cannon, were sent forward; the
Prussian line was then out-flanked, and Bulow driven back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>

<p>At about 5 o'clock Count d'Erlon had taken possession
of the village of Ter-la-Haye; out-flanking the English
left and Bulow's right. It appears that Count Milhaud's
cuirassiers&mdash;which Ney had so often led against the enemy,
and who were behind d'Erlon&mdash;and the Chasseurs of the
Guard, supported by an incessant fire from the infantry
of General Lefebvre-Desnoettes, dashed across the plain
beyond the farm of La Haye Sainte. The advance of
eight regiments and four brigades of their formidable
horsemen created a great sensation, as it was believed the
final moment was come. As General Milhaud passed
before Lefebvre-Desnoettes, he grasped his hand and said,
"I am going to charge, support me!" The commander
of the light cavalry of the Guard believed it was by order
of the Emperor he was desired to support the cuirassiers,
and following their movement he took up a position behind
them. It was Ney's belief, as he had said to Druot, that
were he allowed to act he could, unaided, with such a
body of noble cavalry at his disposal, now put an end to
the English army.</p>

<p>A fierce struggle ensued in which Ney had some
advantage over the English, but not what had been
expected. He now hastened towards Lefebvre-Desnoettes,
made a signal to advance, and precipitated him on the
Duke of Wellington's English and German cavalry. This
charge allowed the somewhat disorganized cuirassiers time
to form again, and they, with the chasseurs and lancers, fell
again upon the English cavalry. Thousands of hand-to-hand
conflicts now were in progress, ending in the enemy
retreating behind the squares of the English infantry, thus
stopping the onward progress of the French horsemen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span></p>

<p>Ney had two horses killed under him, but he was still
determined to fulfill his vow to break the English lines.
Observing now, on the other side of the plateau, 3,000
cuirassiers and 2,000 mounted grenadiers of the Guard that
had not been yet engaged, the Marshal asked that they be
given him to complete the victory.</p>

<p>About 6 o'clock there was disorder in a great part of
the Duke of Wellington's army. The ranks were thinned
by the number killed, by those carried off wounded, and
by desertions. Soldiers of various nations, Belgian,
Hanoverian and English "crowded to the rear" and fled
in a panic from this dreadful action. "A number of
our own dismounted dragoons" says Captain Pringle,
"together with a portion of our infantry, were glad to
escape from the field. These thronged the road leading
to Brussels, in a manner that none but an eye-witness
could have believed."</p>

<p>Cries of "Victory!" now resounded from the French
over different parts of the field. Napoleon on hearing this,
observed,&mdash;"It is an hour too soon; but we must support
what is done." He then sent an order for a grand
charge of three thousand cuirassiers under Kellerman on
the left, and who were to move forward briskly and support
the cavalry on the low grounds.</p>

<p>A distant cannonade was now heard in the direction of
Wavres. It announced the approach of Grouchy&mdash;or
Blucher!</p>

<p>At 12:30 o'clock Grouchy was midway between
Gembloux and Wavres. The tremendous cannonade of
Waterloo resounded from the distance. General Excelmans
rode up to the marshal, and told him that "he was
convinced that the Emperor must be in action with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
Anglo-Belgian army; that so terrible a fire could not be
an affair of outposts or skirmishing; and that they ought
to march to the scene of action, which, by turning to the
left, they might reach within two hours."</p>

<p>Grouchy paused awhile, and then reverted to his orders
to follow Blucher, although he did not know where Blucher
really was. Count Girard came up, and joined in the
advice of General Excelmans. Still Grouchy remained
doubtful, and as if stupefied. "At one moment" says
Hazlitt "he appeared convinced; but just then a report
came that the Prussians were at Wavres, and he set out
once more after them," instead of instantly hurrying off
to join the Emperor in his great battle.</p>

<p>It was a rear-guard which Blucher had left at Wavres;
and the Prussian leader had gone to Waterloo, at the head
of 30,000 men, having been advised, as previously stated,
that the Duke of Wellington would hazard a battle on the
morning of the 18th, if he could depend on the co-operation
of the Prussians. The veteran marshal, at an early
hour, had detached the corps of Bulow, with orders to
march on St. Lambert, leaving Mielman with his corps at
Wavres.</p>

<p>The Duke had expected to be joined by Blucher as
early as 11 o'clock; but the roads were in such a
condition that the Prussians could not accomplish the
march in any such time as had been calculated. Their
advance was necessarily slow,&mdash;but it was in the right
direction!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Emperor on the battlefield of Waterloo,
had reluctantly ordered the charge of Kellerman's three
thousand cuirassiers, asked for by Ney, to sustain and
follow up the advantage of the cuirassiers of Milhaud and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
the chasseurs of the Guard, on the plain below. The
marshal's contest had been carefully watched by Napoleon
who declared at once that Ney was too impatient,
and had begun an hour too soon. "This man is always
the same." said Marshal Soult. "He will compromise
everything as he did at Jena and Eylau."</p>

<p>Kellerman was now all ready for action, but he condemned
the desperate use which at this moment was to be
made of the cavalry. Distrusting the result, he kept
back one of his brigades, the carbineers, and most
unwillingly sent the remainder to Ney, whom he accused
of foolish zeal.</p>

<p>These twenty squadrons, led on by their generals and
officers, now advanced at full gallop as if in pursuit of
the English army, shouting, "Vive l'Empereur!" and
under the cannonade of the Prussians, for Bulow was still
pressing upon the flank and rear. Other bodies of
cavalry also advanced upon the centre of the Anglo-Belgian
army, making a spectacle which General Foy, an
eye-witness, afterwards declared that during his long
military career he had never been present at such a fearful
scene as he then beheld.</p>

<p>While Napoleon was watching their several charges,
General Guyot's division of heavy cavalry was seen
following the cuirassiers of Kellerman. This latter movement
was without the Emperor's orders, and seems to
have been the result of ungovernable excitement on the
part of the officers and men, who thought they could
finish the battle by a <i>coup de main</i>.</p>

<p>The Emperor instantly sent Count Bertrand to recall
them; but it was too late! The cavalry, once started,
nothing could arrest its rush&mdash;they were in action before
the order could reach them; and to recall them now
would have been dangerous, even if possible. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
division was the reserve, and ought by all means to have
been held back. Thus was the Emperor deprived of his
reserve of cavalry as early as 5 o'clock.</p>

</div>

<p>It is said that during the preparation of this grand
charge of 12,000 French cavalry,&mdash;the finest in the world,&mdash;the
Duke of Wellington ran forward with his glass in
front of the lines, amidst the hot fire which preceded the
charge. He was reminded that he was exposing himself
too much. "Yes," said the Duke, "I know I am,&mdash;but
I must see what they are doing." To an officer who
asked for instructions in case he should be slain, he
answered; "I have no instructions to give; there is only
one thing to be done&mdash;to fight to the last man and the last
moment!"</p>

<p>Some years later the Duke said, "I have never seen
anything more admirable in war than those ten or twelve
reiterated charges of the French cuirassiers upon our
troops of all arms."</p>

<p>It was obvious to the English commander, as he viewed
this splendid spectacle, that unless this last and decisive
onset should drive him from the post which he had continued
to hold during nearly seven hours of intermitting
battle, his allies would come fully into the field and give
him a vast superiority of numbers wherewith to close the
work of the day. The Duke now decided to sacrifice the
remainder of his cavalry, and he moved them forward to
meet the shock of the advancing foe.</p>

<p>The matchless body of French cavalry continued to dash
forward towards the hostile lines, in successive masses,
and with all the triumphant fury of a charge upon a
retreating enemy. Breaking through many squares of
infantry, overthrowing the opposing cavalry, and overwhelming
the artillery in front of the lines, they were
received by the squares of British infantry, first with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
volley of musket-balls, and then upon the immovable
array of bristling bayonets. Men and horses, struggling
in the agonies of violent death, bestrewed the ground. In
his extremity Wellington determined on employing Cumberland's
one thousand hussars, who had not yet been
engaged; but at sight of this scene of slaughter the
hussars fell back in disorder.</p>

<p>The resistance of the Duke was most stubborn but
Ney still hoped to destroy the English army at the point
of the sword by keeping up a continued charge, having
been reinforced by the heavy cavalry of the Guard whose
advance had been made apparently without orders.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ney, seeing Kellerman's carbineers in
reserve, hastened to where they were, asked what they
were doing and then, despite Kellerman's resistance, led
them to the front where they succeeded in making fresh
breaches in the British infantry, but were unable to get
beyond the second line.</p>

<p>For the eleventh time Ney led on his 10,000 horse to
the attack. The cuirassiers wheeled about, reformed,
and again charged with tremendous energy, and a valor
that set at contemptuous defiance the tempest of grape-shot,
and balls of the artillery and musketry which
opposed their advance. Men rolled off, and horses fell
plunging; even pistols were discharged in their faces,
and swords thrust over their bayonets in vain. The
British infantry, though shaken for a moment again
closed their ranks, fell into line and continued to fire.
About this time Ney was heard to say to General d'Erlon,
"Be sure, my friend, that for you and me, if we do not
die here under the English balls, nothing remains but to
fall miserably under those of the émigrés." To his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
artillery a few moments before he had said, "It is here,
my friends, that the fate of our country is about to be
decided; it is here that we must conquer in order to secure
our independence!"</p>

<p>The Emperor, who was now suffering great bodily pain,
scarcely able to sit upon his horse, and falling at times
into a sort of lethargy, was much moved by this spectacle.
He had never before commanded in person against the
English soldiery; but he knew them now&mdash;when it was
too late! He observed their wonderful self-command, and
unflinching courage, and praised it;&mdash;but it was his ruin!</p>

<p>Again and again did the brilliant cavalry of the French
rush forward to the charge with redoubled fury. They
frequently passed between the squares of the first line
amidst their united cross-fire from front and rear, and
charged the squares of the second line whose fire they also
received, but no general effect was produced, no real
advantage gained beyond an occasional breaking of the
squares in both lines, particularly the second. The
baffled cuirassiers were always obliged to retire, receiving
the terrible cross-fire of the squares as they passed between
them and followed by a volley of musketry and often by
the grape-shot of the artillery.</p>

<p>Four thousand of the French cavalry now strewed the
ground, while 10,000 English, horse and foot had laid
down their lives. Many were the deeds of individual
gallantry performed by officers and men on both sides,
among cavalry and infantry all over the field. During
the conflict Colonel Heymes hastened to Napoleon to ask
for the infantry of which Ney was in need. "Infantry!"
cried the Emperor, with considerable irritation, "where
does he suppose I can get them? Does he expect me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
make them? You can see the task before me, and you
see what troops I have!" When the Emperor's irritation
had somewhat subsided he sent another message to Ney,
more hopeful than the former. He made Colonel Heymes
tell the marshal that if he were in a difficult position at
Mont St. Jean, he was himself in still greater difficulties
on the banks of the Lasne, where he was opposed by the
entire Prussian army, but when he had repelled, or even
checked them, he, with the Guard, would hasten to
complete the conquest of the English; until then the
plateau was to be held at any cost for an hour when he
might reckon on reinforcements.</p>

<p>The desperate assaults of the French cavalry ought to
have been supported by strong bodies of infantry; they
could not, however, be spared, being needed for the contest
with Bulow, on the French right and to prevent his
advance.</p>

<p>By 7 o'clock, Bulow's corps of 30,000 men was successfully
repulsed, and Count Lobau, with 10,000 men,
occupied the positions from which the Prussian general
had been driven.</p>

<p>Still the French cavalry could do no more than maintain
itself on the plateau from which the Duke's 36,000 men had
made a slight retrograde movement. A fresh cannonade
was opened by the French along the British line, after the
assaults of the cuirassiers, but no further advance was
attempted by the former. As one authority truly says,
the British were beaten to a stand-still&mdash;<i>but there they
stood!</i> It was, in effect, a drawn battle up to this time.</p>

<p>There was not the least demonstration on the part of
the Duke of Wellington to make any general advance
during this almost interminable contest,&mdash;nor had there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
been all day,&mdash;and as little sign of his moving back.
About twenty thousand men had already been killed, or
otherwise lost, on each side.</p>

<p>It was now nearly 7 o'clock. The distant cannonade,
which had been faintly heard in the direction of Wavres,
opened nearer at hand. It was the announcement,&mdash;not
of the arrival of Grouchy, in the rear of Bulow's division;
but that of the two columns of Blucher, amounting to
about 31,000 fresh troops!</p>

<p>The relative strength of the two armies, allowing
twenty thousand as lost on both sides, was now considerably
over two to one against the French,&mdash;the majority
on the other side being chiefly composed of fresh men.
Wellington was heard to say during the day, "Would
to God that Blucher or night would come!" and now both
were at hand.</p>

<p>The presence of mind of the Emperor now became most
alert, and it was never so clearly manifested as at this
critical moment when everything hung in the balance.</p>

<p>The fresh army, advancing to the assistance of the
Anglo-Belgian forces, was soon discovered by the French
troops, who were in action on the field. The cavalry
on the plain were waiting in constant expectation of
the Emperor's orders for the advance of his reserves
of the infantry of the Guard. They were not alarmed
when they saw the communication finally effected
between Bulow and the English, but when they perceived
the approach of the dense columns of Blucher, they were
confounded, and several regiments began to fall back.</p>

<p>Napoleon now sent his aides-de-camp along the whole
line to announce the arrival of succor, and that Blucher's
advance was only a retreat before Grouchy, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
pressing on his rear. It was a clever ruse, and warranted
by the situation in which he now found himself, as it
momentarily revived the spirits of the weary troops to a
wonderful degree.</p>

<p>At the head of four battalions of the infantry of the
Guard, the Emperor now advanced on the left in front of
La Haye Sainte. He ordered General Reille to concentrate
the whole of his corps near Hougomont and make an
attack. He then sent General Friant to support the
cavalry on the plain with four battalions of the middle
guard. If, by sudden charge, they could break and
disorder the centre of the British line before the columns
of Blucher could force their way into the plain, a last
chance of success still remained. Blucher was hurrying
on to La Haye; there was not a moment to lose!</p>

<p>The attack was made, the infantry drove back all that
opposed them, and repeated charges of the French cavalry
disordered the hostile ranks. Presently some battalions
of the Old Guard came up. They too were going to the
attack to retrieve the ground lost by the young guard
who had fallen back, for, as Thiers says, "It is the
privilege of the Old Guard to repair every disaster." The
Emperor ranged his veterans by brigades; two battalions
being in line, and two in column. As he rode along in
front of these battle-scarred battalions, he said, "My
friends, the decisive moment is come; it will not do to fire;
you must come hand to hand with the enemy, and drive
them back at the point of the bayonet into the ravine
whence they have issued to threaten the army, the Empire
and France."</p>

<p>General Friant was now carried by, wounded. He said
that all was going well, but that the attack could not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
successful till the balance of the Guard were employed.
This movement could not be effected on the instant and in
a few minutes it was too late, as the Prussians were coming
up in great numbers. The British still stood on the
defensive and Blucher had reached the village of La Haye.
A violent struggle now ensued, but it was of brief duration;
the overwhelming mass of fresh men soon bore down
all opposition.</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington now prepared,&mdash;for the first
time during the day,&mdash;to advance his entire line. He was
aware that the decisive moment was at hand and that his
safety, as well as that of his gallant men, depended on this
last effort.</p>

<p>A panic soon seized some of the French soldiers,
exhausted and maddened by the terrible strain they had
undergone during the day, and at the sudden appearance
before them of the dark mass of fresh assailants, the cry
of "Sauve qui peut!" (Every man for himself!) was
raised. The disorder soon became general and the men
fled as the columns of Prussians poured into the plain.</p>

<p>Napoleon instantly changed the front of the Guard so
as to throw its left on La Haye Sainte and its right on
La Belle Alliance; he then met the fugitives and led them
back to their post. They at once faced the Prussians, whom
they immediately charged. The fresh brigade of the
English cavalry from Ohain arrived at this crisis and forced
their way between General Reille's corps and the Guard,
to their utter separation. The Emperor now ordered his
four reserve squadrons to charge the fresh brigade of
English cavalry but their attack met with no success. As
he was leading the four battalions destined to their place
of attack on the Charleroi road he met Ney, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
greatly excited, and who declared that the cavalry would
certainly give way if a large reinforcement of infantry did
not immediately arrive. Napoleon gave him the battalions
he was bringing up and promised to send six more.</p>

<p>The ranks of the French were now in general confusion
all over the field. Napoleon had barely time to gallop
into one of the squares of the Guard which still maintained
its position; Ney, Jerome, Soult, Bertrand, Druot,
Corbineau, de Flahaut, Labedoyere, Gourgaud and others
drew their swords, became soldiers again and followed
close to their chiefs heels. They entered the square of
the last battalion of reserve,&mdash;the illustrious and unfortunate
remains of the "granite column" of the fields
of Marengo, who had remained unshaken amidst the
tumultuous waves of the army. The old grenadiers,
incapable of fear for themselves, were alarmed at the
danger threatening the Emperor, and appealed to him to
withdraw. "Retire" said one of them, "You see that
death shuns you!" The Emperor resisted, and commanded
them to fire.</p>

<p>The four battalions of the Guard, and the cavalry which
had so long held the plains below in opposition to the
whole Anglo-Belgian army, were being rapidly depleted.
Wellington had ordered Maitland's guards to fire on them
at short range as they moved forward for the last time. The
sudden shock did not cause the advancing soldiers to stop,
but closing their ranks they continued to push on. They
were soon beaten, however, by overwhelming numbers of
cavalry, both English and Prussian, and were at last
compelled to retire that they might not be cut off from the
centre of the army, while the enemy continued to advance,
preceded by their artillery, which poured forth a most
destructive fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<p>But one last effort to stem the torrent still remained.
If the British centre could be broken, and their advance
checked, some favorable chance was just possible. The
Emperor therefore ordered the advance of the reserve
infantry of the Imperial Guard,&mdash;the flower of his army.
He exhorted them, by a hasty personal appeal, and
confided the direction of their efforts to "the bravest of the
brave," who had had five horses killed under him and who
now advanced on foot, sword in hand. The 2900 heroic stalwarts
moved forward in two columns, headed by Ney, and
supported by a heavy fire of artillery, while four battalions
of the Old Guard, formed into squares, took post in their
rear as a reserve and to protect the march of the columns.</p>

<p>Either wing of the English had by this time
advanced in consequence of the repulses of the French and
their line now presented a concave. They were formed in
an unbroken array, four deep, and as the French advanced
poured on them a shower which never intermitted, each
man firing as often as he could reload. Wellington gave
the order to advance in the familiar and brusque terms of,
"Up guards and at them!" The English wings kept
moving on all the while; and when the heads of the
French columns, who continued to advance till within
forty or fifty yards, approached to this point, they were
met with such a storm of musketry in front, and on either
flank, that they in vain endeavored to deploy into line for
the attack, under a terrific and unremitting fire. They
stopped to make this attempt, reeled, lost order, and the
800 men who were left standing fled at last in one mass
of confusion.</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington now dismounted, placed
himself at the head of his line and led his men against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
remaining numbers of four battalions of the Old Guard&mdash;the
only unbroken troops remaining behind, while Ney
was striving to rally his fugitives. His cocked hat was
gone, and his clothes were literally riddled with bullets,
though he himself remained untouched. The intrepid
marshal, at Wellington's approach, took part once more
in the mêlée, sword in hand, and on foot. But nothing
could withstand the impetuous assault of the victorious
British.</p>

<p>Napoleon, who had watched this last terrible contest
from the heights of La Belle Alliance suddenly exclaimed,
"They are mingled together, all is lost for the present,"
and accompanied by but three or four officers, he gave
the signal for retreat and hurried to the left of Planchenois,
to a second position, where he had placed a regiment of
the Guard, with two batteries in reserve.</p>

<p>The four battalions of the Old Guard, under General
Cambronne, still remained to protect the retreat of the
French army. If they could succeed in holding the
British in check, and prevent their advance during
half an hour longer, darkness would enable the army to
retreat in safety, and partially recover its disorder by
morning. The Old Guard formed in square, flanked by a
few pieces of artillery, and by a brigade of red lancers.
"The Duke of Wellington" says Captain Pringle, "now
ordered his whole line to advance and attack their position."
They advanced to the charge in embattled array,
condensed and tremendous, against the remnant of noble
veterans of that old Imperial Guard, which, during
twenty years of slaughterous wars, had never once been
vanquished. Gathering round the standards of their
former glory, they received the dreadful onset with souls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
prepared for death. Nothing could now withstand the
vigor of the attack of the British soldiers who thus had an
opportunity to relieve their breasts of the heavy burden
they had borne all day when compelled, for hours, to
stand the fierce attacks of the French, being frequently
driven back, and never making an advance.</p>

<p>The Old Guard, as was to be expected, were beaten
down,&mdash;slaughtered. Their general, Cambronne, was
called upon to surrender by some British officers who
seemed to revolt at the uneven contest. The only reply
made by him was,&mdash;not the generally believed, but
inaccurate declaration recorded by some historians, "The
Old Guard dies, but does not surrender!" but was a single
word of military jargon frequently used by French
soldiers. Almost immediately afterwards he fell from his
horse, cut down by a fragment of a shell striking him on
the head; but he would not allow his men to leave their
ranks to bear him away.</p>

<p>Once more these heroes, now reduced to but one
hundred and fifty men, are commanded to surrender;
"We will not yield!" they answer back, and discharging
their muskets for the last time, rush on the cavalry
and with their bayonets, kill many men and horses, and
then sink to the earth exhausted or in death.</p>

<p>The Old Guard was destroyed,&mdash;not defeated! The
advancing British troops rode over their prostrate bodies
piled in ghastly heaps,&mdash;a monument to their valor and
heroism, even in death. Ney, bareheaded, his clothes
hanging in shreds, and with his broken sword in his hand,
seeing a handful of his followers still remaining, ran
forward to lead them against a Prussian column that was
pursuing them. As the fearless marshal threw himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
once more into the fray he exclaimed, "Come my friends;
come see how a marshal of France can die!" But his
time had not come: he was not destined to die upon the
battlefield. His small band was soon overpowered and
scarcely two hundred escaped death. Rulliere, who
commanded the battalion, broke the flag-staff, hid the
eagle beneath his coat, and followed Ney who had been
unhorsed for the fifth time, but who was still unwounded.
Under cover of the darkness they made their escape.</p>

<p>The Emperor attempted to protect the retreat and rally
the fugitives; but it was now fast growing dark. The
soldiers could not see him or they might have rallied, while
many believed the report that he had been killed. "He is
wounded," said some, "He is dead" cried others.
Nothing could be heard above the uproar and hideous
confusion that everywhere prevailed. The Prussian
cavalry, supported by some battalions of infantry, and the
whole of Bulow's corps, now advanced by the right of
Planchenois.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the Emperor was almost surrounded
by hostile forces. He had formed the regiment into a
square, and was still lingering, when Marshal Soult seized
the bridle of his horse, exclaimed that he would not
be killed, but taken prisoner, and, pulling him away, the
Emperor at last yielded to his destiny! Behind him on
the battlefield lay 60,000 French, English and Prussians,
dead or wounded. The battle of Waterloo was lost and
this hitherto almost invincible warrior was obliged to
gallop across the fields in the dark, amidst the whistling of
the Prussian bullets, and detachments of their cavalry
which were scouring the field in all directions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span></p>

<p>Napoleon was so fatigued, on the road to Genappe,
that he would no doubt have fallen from his horse, had he
not been supported by General Gourgaud and two other
persons, who remained his only attendants for some time.</p>

<p>Wellington and Blucher met about 10 o'clock, at the
farm-house of La Belle Alliance, and after congratulating
each other on the success of the day, the Prussian commander,
whose men were still fresh, eagerly undertook to
continue the pursuit during the night, while the English
general halted to rest his weary men and care for the dead
and wounded.</p>

<p>The English loss on this eventful day was 100 officers
slain and 500 wounded; very many mortally. The Duke
who was himself exposed to great danger throughout the
day, and one other person, were the only two among his
numerous staff who escaped unhurt. The enemy, according
to their own accounts, lost over thirty thousand men,
including Hanoverians, Belgian troops of Nassau, Brunswick,
etc.; those of the English army alone amounted
to 22,800; to which are to be added 8,000 to 10,000
Prussians. Of the 72,000 men whom Napoleon headed
in this, his 85th pitched battle and greatest defeat, not
more than 30,000 were ever again collected in arms. The
remainder were either killed or wounded on the battlefield,
or deserted and fled separately to their homes, or were
murdered by the Prussians who followed hard on the
miserable and defenseless fugitives, cutting down all they
overtook without resistance or mercy.</p>

<p>Several French officers blew out their brains to escape
their brutality and some of the veterans of the Imperial
Guard, who lay wounded upon the battlefield, killed
themselves when they heard the Emperor had lost the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
battle, in order that they might not fall into the hands of
the enemy, or through remorse at the downfall of their
chief.</p>

<p>Napoleon made a brief halt at Genappe, at about 11
o'clock at night; but all his attempts to rally the frantic
masses were in vain. He then continued his course
towards Quatre-Bras, where he dismounted at a bivouac
at about 1 o'clock in the morning. At Phillipville, he
received news of Grouchy's movements, and sent him
word of the loss of Mont St. Jean, (Waterloo).</p>

<p>At this point he caused orders to be dispatched to
Generals Rapp, Lecourbe and Lamarque, to proceed by
forced marches to Paris, and to commanders of fortified
towns to defend themselves to the last extremity. He
also dictated two letters to his brother Joseph, one to be
communicated to the council of ministers relating imperfectly
the fatal issue of the day, and the other for his
private perusal giving a faithful account of the total rout
of the army, and declaring that he would soon have an
army of 300,000 troops with which to oppose the enemy.
The Duke of Bassano (Maret) and Baron Fleury now came
up and greeted the Emperor who was much affected at
meeting them, and was scarcely able to suppress his emotions.
He then prepared to set off in a calash, accompanied
by Bertrand. At Rocroi, where Napoleon stopped
to take refreshments, his attendants appeared in a pitiable
state; their clothes were covered with blood and dust,
their looks were haggard, and their eyes were filled with
tears. Napoleon continued his journey to Paris, via
Laon, accompanied by two or three hundred fugitives,
who had been collected to form an escort, arriving at the
capital on the evening of the 20th of June.</p>

CONCLUSION</h2>

<p class="p2">The "military career" of Napoleon Bonaparte having
ended at Waterloo, but little remains to be added here.
Other writers, especially those noble self-sacrificing friends
who shared with the Exile his life at St. Helena, have told
in detail of his weary hours on the rocks in the Atlantic
Ocean, and a brief summary of the events which finally
ended in Napoleon becoming a prisoner of England for
life will only be recited.</p>

<p>The arrival of the Emperor at Paris had been preceded by
the news&mdash;received on June 19th, of the victories at Charleroi
and Ligny, and one hundred cannon had been fired in
honor of his successes. On the morning of the 21st it
became known that the Emperor had arrived the night
before, at the Elysée. When he stopped at the flight of
steps leading to the palace General Druot, who had accompanied
him exclaimed, "All is lost!" "Except honor,"
answered Napoleon quickly. He had not spoken before
since leaving Laon.</p>

<p>Immediately on his arrival the Emperor was received
by Caulaincourt&mdash;his censor in prosperity and real friend
in adversity. To him he said, with head bowed by grief
and fatigue, "The army performed prodigies; a panic
seized it, and all was lost. Ney conducted himself like a
madman; he got my cavalry massacred. I can say no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
more&mdash;I must have two hours' rest, to enable me to prepare
for business"; "I am choking here!" he exclaimed a
moment later, laying his hand upon his heart. After
ordering a bath, and a few moments silence he said: "My
intention is to assemble the two Chambers in an imperial
sitting and demand the means of saving the country."</p>

<p>He was then informed that the deputies appeared hostile
towards him, and were little disposed to grant his requests.
While he remained in his bath the ministers and great
officers of state hastened towards the Elysée. When
they arrived, his clothes were still covered with dust,
as he had left the field of Waterloo; yet, exhausted
by the fatigues of three battles, and the dreadful events of
his flight and the hurry of his journey being still vivid in
his mind, he gave a rapid but distinct view of the resources
of the country, the strength already organized for resistance,
and the far greater power still capable of development.
Among his listeners were his brothers Joseph and Lucien.</p>

<p>While consulting with his ministers, presided over by
Joseph, on the morning of the 21st, as to what manner he
should inform the Chambers of his great misfortune, news
was received that both assemblies had met on learning of
his defeat and resolutions passed,&mdash;one of which declared
the State to be in danger, and the other that their own
sittings be made permanent. Thus the Chamber of Representatives
overturned the new constitution, and put aside
the authority of the Emperor. These resolutions were
also adopted by the Chamber of Peers. Lucien Bonaparte,
and some of Napoleon's more intimate friends, wished him
to instantly put himself at the head of 6,000 of the Imperial
Guard, who were then in the capital, and dissolve the
Senate, which was unfriendly to him. The Emperor, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>ever,
was undecided; as Lucien said of him ever after
that, "the smoke of Mont St. Jean had turned his brain."</p>

</div>

<p>Late in the evening of the 21st Napoleon held a council
to which the presidents and vice presidents of both
Chambers were admitted, but no decision was arrived at.
Lafayette, the friend of Washington, declared that nothing
could be done until "a great sacrifice could be made."
The Emperor heard all in silence and broke up the meeting
without having come to any decision.</p>

<p>"I have often asked myself," said Napoleon to Las Casas
at St Helena, "whether I have done for the French people
all that they could expect of me&mdash;for that people did
much for me. Will they ever know all that I suffered
during the night that preceded my final decision? In
that night of anguish and uncertainty, I had to choose
between two great courses; the one was to save France by
violence, and the other to yield to the general impulse."
He finally decided that abdication was the only step he
could adopt, and his determination was taken.</p>

<p>Early next morning&mdash;the 22d&mdash;the Chambers again met,
and the necessity of the Emperor's abdication was
discussed with vigor. It was demanded on all hands,
and without any reservation or condition whatever.
Finally, Lafayette instructed that word should be sent
Napoleon that he would be given an hour in which to
abdicate, and be told if he had not done so by that time he
would be deposed. Between noon and 1 o'clock the
abdication was signed and carried by Carnot to the
Chamber of Peers, and by Fouché to the Chamber of
Deputies.</p>

<p>When Fouché appeared, the Deputies were about to
declare the Emperor deposed, and he saved them that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
trouble by producing the following proclamation, in the
handwriting of Joseph Bonaparte, to whom it had been dictated,
and addressed to the French people:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Frenchmen! When I began war for the maintenance
of the national independence, I relied upon the union of
all efforts, all wills and all the national authorities. I had
reason to hope for success, and I braved all the declarations
of the powers against my person. Circumstances appear
to be changed. I offer myself as a sacrifice to the hatred
against France. May they prove sincere in their declarations,
and to have aimed only at me! My political life
is ended. I proclaim my son under the title of Napoleon
II., Emperor of the French. The present ministers will
provisionally form the council of the Government. The
interest which I take in my son induces me to recommend
the Chambers should immediately enact a law for
the organization of a Regency; unite together for the
general safety, and to the end of securing your national
independence. Done at the Palace of the Elysée, June the
22d, 1815.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Napoleon.</span>"</p>

<p>The Chambers had awaited this reply in a state of the
greatest impatience in both houses. In the Chamber of
Peers, Carnot, having received some exaggerated accounts
of the force and success of Grouchy, endeavored to
persuade the Assembly that the marshal must ere then
have added 60,000 men at Laon to Soult, the relics of
Waterloo, thus forming an army capable, under proper
guidance, of yet effectually retrieving the affairs of France.</p>

<p>Ney, who had arrived in Paris the same morning,
declared otherwise. "Grouchy" said he, "cannot have
more than twenty, or at most, more than twenty-five
thousand men; and as to Soult, I myself commanded the
Guard in the last assault&mdash;I saw them all massacred
before I left the field. Be assured there is but one course,&mdash;negotiate
and recall the Bourbons. In their return I see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
nothing but the certainty of being shot as a deserter. I
shall seek all I have henceforth to hope for in America.
Take you the only course that remains for France."</p>

<p>Ney's prophecy was soon to be fulfilled, for on the
return of the Bourbons to the throne he was shot as a
traitor to France, although, as has been frequently said of
him, he fought more than five hundred battles for his
country and never raised arms against her!</p>

<p>A deputation from the Senate waited on the Emperor
at the Elysée, and in respectful terms thanked him for the
sacrifice he had made, but he was unable to exact from
them the avowal that his abdication necessarily carried
with it the immediate proclamation of Napoleon II.</p>

<p>The Emperor, for the last time clothed in imperial
garb, and surrounded by his great officers of state,
received the deputation with calmness and dignity. "I
thank you for the sentiments which you express," he said,
"I desire that my abdication may produce the happiness
of France; but I cannot hope it; the State is left by it
without a chief, without a political existence. The time
lost in overturning the Empire might have been employed
in placing France in a position to crush the enemy. I
recommend that the Chamber promptly reinforce the
armies; whoever wishes for peace must be ready for war.
Do not place this great nation at the mercy of strangers.
Beware of being deceived in your hopes. This is the real
danger. In whatever position I may be placed, I shall
always be satisfied, if France is happy."</p>

<p>He perceived clearly that there was no hope for his son.
Thus ended the second reign&mdash;the "Hundred Days" of
Napoleon. His public career was ended. The council of
ministers broke up, and the palace of the Elysée soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
presented the appearance of being deserted. Napoleon,
surrounded only by a few friends, had now become a private
individual. When Caulaincourt advised him to seek safety
from the Allies in flight to the United States, he replied;
"What have I to fear? I have abdicated&mdash;it is the business
of France to protect me!"</p>

<p>The repeated protestations of Napoleon and his friends,
that unless Napoleon II. was recognized the abdication of
his father was null, and that the country that could hesitate
about such an act of justice was worthy of nothing but
slavery, began to produce a powerful effect among the
soldiery in Paris, and Napoleon was called upon to
signify to the army that he no longer claimed any authority
over them, to which he complied.</p>

<p>A provisional government was now proclaimed, consisting
of Fouché, Carnot, Caulaincourt and Generals Grenier
and Quinette, and installed in the Tuileries. Fouché
declared that Napoleon's continued presence at the capital
might produce disturbance, and Carnot was deputed to
request him to withdraw to Malmaison, which he was compelled
to do on the 25th. Arriving there he soon became
aware of the fact that he was in effect a prisoner, for
Fouché's police surrounded him on all sides&mdash;ostensibly
"to protect his person." It was at Malmaison, in compliance
with the suggestions of some members of the government,
that Napoleon addressed his last proclamation to the army;
"Soldiers!" he said, "When I yield to the necessity which
forces me to separate myself from the brave French army, I
take away with me the happy conviction that it will justify,
by the eminent services which the country expects from it,
the high character which our enemies themselves are not
able to refuse to it. Soldiers! I shall follow your steps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
though absent. I know all the corps, and not one among
them will obtain a single advantage over the enemy that I
shall not render homage to the courage which it will have
shown. You, and I, have been calumniated. Men,
incapable of appreciating your actions, have seen, in the
marks of attachment which you have given me, a zeal of
which I was the whole object; let your future success
teach them that it was the country, above all, that you
served in obeying me, and that if I have any part in your
affection, I owe it to my ardent love of France, our
common mother. Soldiers, some efforts more, and the
coalition will be destroyed. Napoleon will know you by
the blows that you will give to it. Save the honor, the
independence of the French; be what I have known you
for twenty years, and you will be invincible."</p>

<p>This address, however, although written at the instigation
of the government, its representatives would not
allow to be published in the "Moniteur."</p>

<p>The relics of Waterloo, and Grouchy's division, were
now marching towards Paris under Soult, followed
closely by Wellington and Blucher. The provisional
government began to feel some anxiety concerning Napoleon,
whom they feared might make his escape from
Malmaison and place himself at the head of an armed force
to take the field against the invaders, and in favor of
Napoleon II.</p>

<p>General Becker, who had been appointed by Fouché to
the unthankful office of guarding Napoleon, was prevailed
upon to repair to Paris and convey a letter to the government,
in which the ex-Emperor offered to assume the command
of the army and beat the enemy, not with an
intention of seizing the sovereign power, but agreeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
to pursue his journey as soon as victory should give a
favorable turn to the negotiations. In this letter, which
was addressed to the Committee of Government, Napoleon
said: "In abdicating the sovereign authority, I
did not renounce the noblest right of a citizen, that of
defending my country. The approach of the Allies
upon the capital leaves no doubt of their intentions and
bad faith. Under these weighty circumstances, I offer
my service as general, still considering myself the first
soldier of my country!"</p>

<p>Fouché read the letter aloud, and then exclaimed, "Is
he laughing at us? Come, this is going too far." His
proposal was of course rejected, although Carnot was
desirous that his prayer should be granted.</p>

<p>General Becker was instructed to carry back to Malmaison
this response; "The duties of the Committee
toward the country do not permit it to accept the proposition
and the active assistance of the Emperor Napoleon."</p>

<p>He found the Emperor in uniform, believing a favorable
reply would be returned. When he had finished the
missive Napoleon said: "These men are incapable of
energy. Since that is the case, let us go into exile."</p>

<p>Fouché now urged his prisoner to consent to depart
at once for some foreign port&mdash;naming the United States
as a haven in which he might find relief from outside
interference. If Napoleon had acted promptly, as he
had all his life been accustomed to do, he might in all
probability have made his escape to this country, as our
vessels were in every French port&mdash;and he could have
crossed the Atlantic; but he hesitated, and those golden
moments, which meant so much to him, even liberty
itself, were soon irretrievably lost. Fouché, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
extremely anxious to have the man who had made him
all he was out of the way, did not hesitate to resort
to questionable means of pressure to get Napoleon to
leave France. One of these was the stimulating of the
personal creditors of the dethroned Emperor, and his family,
who repaired incessantly to Malmaison to torment him
with their demands.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Fouché sent to the Duke of Wellington
announcing that Napoleon had declared his intention of
departing for America, and requesting for him a safe
conduct across the Atlantic. The Duke replied that he
had no authority to grant passports to Napoleon Bonaparte
but the request, as Fouché hoped, had the effect of
causing the English admirality to quicken their diligence
and there was immediately stationed no less than thirty
cruisers along the western coasts of France in order to
intercept Napoleon should he attempt to depart. No one
could be deceived as to the intention of this proceeding;
it clearly denoted that the men, who, for the moment,
possessed the government of France, had determined that
the late Emperor should not leave the country freely.
The fear that he might return to the capital, and to his
throne, had made them take a step which was certain to
place him in the power of the English government.</p>

<p>The next move was to inform Napoleon of the Duke's reply
and with it the declaration that two frigates, and some
smaller vessels, awaited his orders at Rochefort. He was
informed that "if he repaired thither on the instant" he
would still be in time. For a moment he hesitated,
wavering between hope and doubt. Baron Fleury then
went to Paris and learned that the Prussians designed to
carry off the Emperor; that Blucher had said, "If I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
catch Bonaparte, I will hang him up at the head of my
army," but that Wellington had strenuously opposed such
a cowardly design. At half past 3 o'clock in the morning
Napoleon was informed that Wellington had refused him
safe conduct, and he was ordered to depart immediately from
Malmaison. Preparations were hurriedly made, and on
the 29th of June, eleven days after the battle of Waterloo,
he left Malmaison, accompanied by Savary, Bertrand and
Las Casas, and others of his attached servants, and attended
by a guard of mounted men.</p>

<p>If one of his followers had not taken the precaution to
have the bridges in front of Malmaison burned, Napoleon
would have run a great risk of falling into the hands of
the Allies, as three corps of Prussian cavalry appeared
there in quest of him very soon after he started. They
had arrived by a circuitous route, and must have been led
by a guide well acquainted with the locality. Napoleon,
however, had escaped this danger. He slept at Rambouillet
the first night, at Tours on the 30th, and at Niort
on the 1st of July. He was well received wherever he
was recognized; but at the last named place the enthusiasm
of the people and troops was extreme.</p>

<p>Rochefort was reached on the 3rd of July. Here Napoleon,
who was joined by his brother Joseph, took up his
residence in the prefect's house with the view of embarking
immediately, but he was informed that a British line-of-battle
ship, and some smaller vessels of war, were off the
roads, watching the roadstead and harbor, and his
departure was therefore impossible.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the French army had once more retired from
before the walls of Paris under a convention, and Blucher
and Wellington were about to enter the capital and reseat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
Louis on the throne. The only alternative, therefore, was
to open negotiations with Captain Maitland, who commanded
the Bellerophon, an English man-of-war which
had taken up its station at Rochefort two days before the
arrival of the ex-Emperor.</p>

<p>On being asked for a safe conduct to America the
English commander replied that his orders were to make
every effort to prevent "Bonaparte" from escaping, and
if so fortunate as to obtain possession of his person, to sail
at once with him for England. Savary and Las Casas,
who conducted the negotiations, were unable to exact a
definite promise from the captain, when they visited him
on the 10th of July, or to learn from him if it was the
intention of the British government to throw any impediment
in the way of his voyage to the United States. In
the course of the conversation, Captain Maitland, according
to his own statement, threw out the suggestion, "Why
not seek an asylum in England?" to which various
objections were urged by Savary, and thus the interview
terminated.</p>

<p>The succeeding days were passed by Napoleon in
discussing various plans devised for his escape, but they
were all abandoned by him. He saw no possible chance
of success, for, as he himself said: "Wherever wood
can float, there is the flag of England. I will throw
myself into her hands&mdash;a helpless foe." Then, too,
Napoleon was weary of strife, and had the feelings of one
who had done with action, and whose part it was to
endure. He at last rejected all such proposals, and once
more dispatched Las Casas, accompanied by Lallemand, to
Capt. Maitland, on the 14th of July, with instructions to
inquire again whether the intentions of the British govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>ment
were yet declared as to a passage to America, or if
permission for Napoleon to pass in a neutral vessel could
be obtained. The answer was in the negative; but
Capt. Maitland again suggested his embarkation on board
the Bellerophon, in which case he should be conveyed to
England. The words of Captain Maitland, quoted by
himself to Lord Keith were; "If he chooses to come on
board the ship I command, I think, under the orders I
am acting with, I may venture to receive him, and carry
him to England." Upon this a negotiation took place,
which terminated in Las Casas saying; "Under all
circumstances, I have little doubt that you will see the
Emperor on board the Bellerophon."</p>

<p>Las Casas returned to the Isle of Aix after his interview
with Captain Maitland on the 14th. The result of his
mission appeared to be "that Captain Maitland had
authorized him to tell the Emperor if he decided upon
going to England, he was authorized to receive him on
board; and he accordingly placed his ship at his disposal."
Napoleon then finally made up his mind to place himself
on board the British vessel. On the same day Gourgaud
delivered to Captain Maitland the following letter addressed
to the Prince Regent of England:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Royal Highness:&mdash;Exposed to the factions which divide
my country, and to the hostility of the greatest powers of
Europe, I have closed my political career. I come, like
Themistocles to seek the hospitality of the English nation.
I place myself under the protection of their laws, which
I claim from your Royal Highness as the most powerful,
and most constant, and the most generous of my enemies.</p>

<p>Rochefort, July the 13th, 1815.</p>

<div class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Napoleon.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>The letter was received by the royal commander and
sent to England, but no answer was returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 15th Napoleon and his friends decided to board
the Bellerophon and were transported thither by a barge
sent by Captain Maitland. The parting scenes with
those left behind were most affecting. The English
commander received his charge in a respectful manner,
but without salute or distinguished honors; Napoleon
uncovered himself, on reaching the quarter-deck, and said
in a firm tone of voice, "I come to place myself under the
protection of your prince and laws!"</p>

<p>The captain then led him into the cabin, which was
given up to his use, and afterwards, by his own request,
presented all the officers to him. He visited every part of
the ship during the morning, conversing with much
freedom with those on board, about naval and other affairs.
About noon the ship got under weigh and made sail for
England.</p>

<p>On the 23d of June the Bellerophon passed Ushant, and
for the last time Napoleon gazed long and mournfully on
his beloved country, but said nothing. At daybreak on
the 24th they were close to Dartmouth, and when the ship
was at anchor the captain was instantly admonished by the
Lords of the Admiralty to permit no communication of
any kind between his ship and the coast. On the 26th
the commander was ordered to Plymouth Sound, where he
was the object of great curiosity on the part of thousands
of people who swarmed about the vessel in small boats,
eager to behold the man who had had the attention of the
world for so many years. Napoleon appeared on deck
and was greeted with loud cheers, to which he bowed and
smiled in return, and remarked to Captain Maitland:
"The English appear to have a very large portion of
curiosity." On one occasion the captain counted upwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
of a thousand boats within view, each containing on an
average eight people.</p>

<p>On the 31st of July Napoleon was visited by Sir Henry
Bunbury, under-Secretary of State, and Lord Keith
admiral of the channel fleet, who came on board and
announced the final decision of the British government
respecting him, and which was that "General Bonaparte,"
their prisoner, should not be landed on the shores of
England, but removed forthwith to St. Helena, as being
the situation which, more than any other at their
command, the government thought safe against a second
escape, and the indulgence to himself of personal freedom
and exercise, and which might be reconciled with the
"indispensable precautions which it would be necessary
to employ for the security of his person." Secondly,
with the exception of Savary and Lallemand, he was to
be permitted to take with him any three officers he chose,
besides one surgeon and twelve domestics, none of whom
were to be allowed, however, to quit the island without
the sanction of the British government.</p>

<p>Napoleon, on listening to the decree which sealed his
fate for life, made no comment whatever until the reading
of the decision had ended. He then solemnly protested
against their cruel and arbitrary act. He protested, not
only against the order, but against the right claimed by
the English government to dispose of him as a prisoner of
war. "I came into your ship" said he, "as I would
into one of your villages. If I had been told I was to be
a prisoner I would not have come. I asked him if he was
willing to receive me on board, and convey me to England.
Captain Maitland said he was, having received, or telling
me he had received, special orders of government con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>cerning
me. It was a snare then, that had been spread
for me. As for the Island of St. Helena, it would be my
sentence of death. I demand to be received as an English
citizen." He objected strenuously to the title given him,
declared his right to be considered as a sovereign prince,
that his father-in-law, or the Czar, would have treated
him far differently, and concluded by expressing his belief
that "if your government act thus, it will disgrace you in
the eyes of Europe." "Even your own people will
blame it," he added.</p>

<p>His protests were in vain, however, and at length, the
interview having terminated, he was informed that Admiral
Sir George Cockburn was ready to receive him on board
the Northumberland to convey him to St. Helena. Napoleon
then declared with animation, "No, no, I will not go
there; I am not a Hercules; but you shall not conduct me
to St. Helena. I prefer death in this place. You found
me free&mdash;send me back again; replace me in the condition
in which I was, or permit me to go to America." Still his
protests were ignored and preparations were at last begun
for departure. In a private conversation with Captain
Maitland, Napoleon reverted to the painful subject in the
following terms: "The idea is a perfect horror to me. To
be placed for life on an island within the tropics, at an
immense distance from any land, cut off from all communication
with the world, and everything I hold dear to
it! It is worse than Tamerlane's iron cage. I would
prefer being given up to the Bourbons."</p>

<p>Napoleon's suite, as finally arranged, consisted of
Counts Bertrand, Montholon and Las Casas, General
Gourgaud, and Dr. O'Meara, an Irish naval surgeon.
Bertrand and Montholon were accompanied by their ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
and children, and twelve upper domestics of the late
imperial household, who desired to share in the fortunes of
their master. The money, diamonds and salable effects
Napoleon had with him he was deprived of. When the
search of his belongings was in progress, Bertrand was
invited to attend, but he was so indignant at the measure
that he positively refused. Four thousand gold napoleons
($16,000) were taken from him; the rest of the
money, amounting to about one thousand five hundred
napoleons, were returned to enable the Exile to pay such
of is servants as were about to leave him.</p>

<p>The Northumberland sailed for St. Helena on the 8th of
August. After a voyage of about seventy days, without
unusual incident, on the 15th of October, 1815, Napoleon
had his first view of his destined retreat. He was then
forty-six years of age, enjoyed fairly good health, and
but for the repeated denials of many necessary comforts
to which he was now to be subjected might, in a
measure, have enjoyed the remaining years of his life.
Here he found himself immured for life in a small volcanic
island, in the southern Atlantic, measuring ten miles in
length and seven in breadth, at a distance of two thousand
leagues from the scenes of his immortal exploits in arms,
and separated from the two great continents of Africa and
America by the unfathomable ocean.</p>

<p>The admiral landed about noon with a view of finding
a fitting abode for Napoleon and his suite, returning in
the evening. On the 16th the imperial prisoner landed,
and as he left the Northumberland the officers all
assembled on the quarter-deck with nearly the whole of the
crew stationed in the gangways. Before he stepped into
the small boat to be taken ashore he took leave of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
captain and desired him to convey his thanks to his officers
and men. He then made off for the shore to take up his
residence at "the Briars," a small cottage about half a mile
from Jamestown, during the interval which must elapse
before other quarters could be provided for him. On the
10th of December he took possession of his newly appointed
abode at Longwood, a villa about six miles distant from
Jamestown. At this latter place he died on the 5th of May
1821 at half past 5 o'clock in the evening, after an exile of
nearly six years. His death was no doubt hastened by a
succession of petty annoyances on the part of his "jailer,"
Sir Hudson Lowe, governor of the island, which began
on his arrival, and were followed up during all
the years of his exile, despite his repeated protestations.
He had already lived much longer than he desired, and
had completed all his preparations for death's coming,
during his last year of bad health. In his final hours he
was surrounded by Bertrand, Montholon and other devoted
friends to whom he had given his final instructions.</p>

<p>Four days later, or on May 9th, with the cloak he
had worn at Marengo thrown over his feet, and clothed in
the uniform of the Chasseurs of his Guard, he was buried
with military honors, surrounded by the sorrowing friends
who had shared his long confinement. The only inscription
permitted on the tablet over his body was "General
Bonaparte."</p>

<p>Nineteen years later, at the request of the French
government, England honored a request for his ashes,
and his body was disinterred and conveyed to France to
rest once more "on the banks of the Seine, among the
French people whom he had loved so well." On December
15th 1840, in the midst of the most imposing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
magnificent ceremonies Paris had ever witnessed, the body
of the Emperor was borne to the Invalides where it lay
for many days publicly exposed. On the 6th of February
1841 the coffin was taken from the imperial cenotaph and
placed in the chapel of St. Jerome, in the Church of the
Invalides where it was to remain till the completion of the
mausoleum some years later. Beneath the golden dome
which crowns the Invalides, and towards which the faces
of all visitors to Paris are most frequently turned, there
still rests all that is mortal of this most wonderful warrior
and statesman. His magic name continues to defy even
time itself, and as the years roll on each generation
inquires of its predecessors what they knew of this man
who was so great that his name fills more pages in the
world's solemn history than that of any other mortal.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
